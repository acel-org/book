# How The Decels Decel

While those adhering to woke ideology are certainly against an accelerant humanity, it is the Decels who remain our true enemy. This group, primarily politicians and influential figures who simply peddle wokeism when it is convenient for them, are the ones truly capable of undermining our individual agency. For they are able to inflict legislative damage in the modern socio-political landscape. In one look, we see how the pattern of the laws and regulations they champion profoundly inhibit individual freedom — each deployment of power a transgressive restriction on human potential. The jurisdiction of Decels, as we'll see, is far-ranging. Each are accosted, deterritorialized, and threatened by agency-killing forces; and each must be acknowledged so that they may be liberated from the clutches of Decels.

## Travel & Energy

When it comes to energy use and modern travel, Decels, deploying woke ideology so far as it suits their needs, clang the alarm bell of climate change and shout demands of strict environmental regulations, unethically backing policies that distort free market availability. The Heritage Foundation, a D.C. based conservative think tank, stated of this, "\[Chair of the Federal Reserve] Powell and other Fed members have routinely opined about climate change, diversity, equity and other left-wing talking points," an especially regrettable point given that the Federal Reserve itself has stated "that the Fed must avoid politics to maintain its independence... We are not, and will not be, a ‘climate policy maker’" ([Antoni](https://www.heritage.org/markets-and-finance/commentary/wokeness-slowly-hollowing-out-the-fed)). "And yet," according to The Heritage, "that is precisely what is going on at the Fed, which has proposed a new rule ... that rule would penalize reliable domestic American energy while subsidizing “green” energy projects like solar and wind" (Antoni). In essence, "...the Fed’s proposed regulatory rule on climate change will... consider 'green' investments to be safer than their actual financial position, while conventional, reliable energy sources will have a risk premium. That incentivizes investment in wind and solar, effectively creating a subsidy, while penalizing investment in coal, oil, and natural gas" (Antoni).&#x20;

This slippery slope&#x20;

To Decels, the utilization of energy, without conversation or debate, is predetermined as a cardinal sin: Fossil Fuels? Evil. Certain types of renewable energy? Evil. This conversation-less, debate-less arena only creates a reductionist societal pressure whereby one's energy usage is limited to the equivalent of their virtue -- if that is somehow possible. This asinine understanding of how the free market deals with traded goods not only dims actual understandings of what is possible in the way of personal comfort and convenience; at the same time, it undercuts economic growth and innovation, keeping us in a more controlled and less independent society.&#x20;

More so, their advocacy for increased air travel taxes, their restrictions on car ownership, and their maximalist push for public transportation as the only "sustainable option" -- all of these ideations insensibly, short-sightedly would destroy the same markets that they use to Über to their rallies.&#x20;

Antoni finishes, "For the sake of the Republic, people must reject the woke agenda of the radical left."&#x20;

## Sexual Identity

As it is such an amorphous area of virtue, Decels are obsessed with planting their flag on what is _right_ in sexual ideology, in a way that without fail dismantles the integrity of the family and social stability. Perpetrators of Wokeism subtly, or outspokenly, encourage lifestyles and identities that lead society towards diminished birth rates and, in extreme measures, all the way through to gender reassignment and even castration. Such acts of unbridled depravity are undoubtedly regarded as attacks against biological agency and frontline reproductive capacity, weakening our genetic and memetic social fabric little by little.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:green;">Universal</mark> Basic Income:

UBI sounds like a dream come true: free money for everyone! However, scratch below the surface, and you will find something obscured----it is one of the tools that Decels use to undermine self-agency. By disincentivizing work and productivity, UBI engenders people's dependency on the state. Such Dependency makes them less driven towards self-improvement and entrepreneurship and more compliant, less autonomous members of society.&#x20;

## Freedom of Speech

Freedom of speech is not in the Decels' playbook; they implement "hate speech" laws and police online platforms, devloping environments that quickly shut off dissenting opinions. Open debate and the free flow of ideas--two staples for a free, autonomous society--are smothered under their watch, indicative of how they prefer little backtalk from the general population.&#x20;

## Regulation of Trade

Decels are no friends of the free market either. Keen on heavy regulation, higher taxes, and central control over industries, they strangle entrepreneurial pursuits with a tight rein on the free exchange of goods and services. This is economic "strangulation"---inhibiting individuals attempting to create wealth and attain their economic goals independently---  used to keep the systems of finance in their tight grasp.

## Minority "Pedestaling"

Whereas advocacy for the rights of minorities is good, the Decels take it rather to the extreme and focus dispro­portionately on issues concerning minorities at the expense of the majority. This kind of fixation is what results in policies that tend to favor one group over another, finally causing division with feelings of resentment among those in society. It also reduces the attention given to broader issues, such as the ones affecting self-agency of the general population

## Wealth Redistribution

Redistributing the wealth—one of the cornerstones of the Decels' agenda—means taking from those who are productive to give to those who are nonproductive. With their discouragement of productivity and success, such compelled redistribution will break down the incentive structure that supports a free and prosperous society; punishing those working toward economic betterment and rewarding complacency.

## Memes, themselves

Believe it or not, Decels have it out for memes too. Labeling these bits of modern humor and commentary as harmful or illegal is their way of seeking to regulate and censor this vibrant form of expression. The ostensible crack down on memes suppresses creativity and social commentary; in doing so, this infringes on our right to free expression, making one wonder—since when has a meme ever hurt anyone?

## Diet

Unsurprisingly, the Decels support sugar intake, alcohol drinking, and processed foods---knowing full well that they are dangerous. By fostering unhealthy lifestyles, they are securing and under-healthy and less energetic population. This encouragement of unhealthy lifestyle practices depletes the ability for individuals to sustainably maintain their physical and mental health and henceforth further limits aspects of their self-agency and autonomy.&#x20;

By these means, the Decels gradually undermine the very foundation of self-agency, molding a more controlled society and fewer independent beings. Whether it be clipping our wings, policing everything that comes out from our mouths, or generally making us dependent on them, the message comes across strong: they simply prefer a world in which freedom will bend under their image of collective control
