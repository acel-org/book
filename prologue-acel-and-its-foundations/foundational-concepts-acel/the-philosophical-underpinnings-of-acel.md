# The Philosophical Underpinnings of ACEL

## Early Influences

When teased apart, the ideas that compose the theoretical basis of ACEL prove to be pulled from a number of schools of thought, then synthesized into a coherent whole. Some very important thinkers play into this movement's considerations: German Idealist G.W.F. Hegel and Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises seem to have contributing pieces to Accelerationist philosophy.&#x20;

### _Progress_ and Hegel's Dialectic

At the very root of Accelerationism sits the concept of _progress_ and _progressing_. Through the lens of this philosophy, progress: 1) almost, if not always, inevitably conflicts with existing structures, 2) abides by a standard order of process, and 3) is above all, absolutely necessary. These three assumptions find a propaedeutic resonance with 19th century G.W.F Hegel's concept of "The Dialectic".&#x20;

A threefold premise (that is in fact, in its True form, one totality coming to become itself once more), Hegel suggested that all forms of thought pass through a standardized order of development, what he calls a "process of coming-to-be": 1) thesis, 2) antithesis, 3) synthesis. In this model, 1) the thesis _affirms_ the original form, 2) the antithesis _negates_ or _contradicts_ the original form (though not in an absolute negative, as it is a teacher), and 3) the _synthesis_ _elevates_ the original form to a higher form (Hegel 15). Hegel states, "It is the process of its own becoming, the circle that presupposes its end as its goal, having its end also as its beginning; and only by being worked out to its end, is it actual (Hegel 10). In short, Hegelian Dialectics standardizes a _formula_ around progress_,_ one applicable to any manifestation of progress, whether it be a student learning French or the changing of world powers -- all always one thing, realizing itself.

These manifestations of The Dialectic for Hegel are all, at one pace or another, moving from a form of lower sophistication to a form of higher sophistication where it realizes Itself once again. That means that processual movement through a dialetic is -- not _should be,_ note -- _always_ _unidirectional._ Hegel explains this as, "logical necessity... the rhythm of the organic whole... The self-moving concrete shape makes itself into a simple determinateness; in so doing it raises itself to logical form, and exists in its essentiality; its concrete existence is just this movement, and is directly a logical existence" (Hegel 34).&#x20;

Each of these existences all have and serve a singular purpose: that they achieve a transcendent reunion with Spirit-itself and Spirit-itself-as-finite. In other words, the goal, or the purpose, of The Dialectic is that its own duality is eventually transcended, again. Hegel says of Spirit, "\[it] becomes alienated from itself and then returns to itself from this alienation, and is, only then revealed for the first time in its actuality and truth" (Hegel 21). This progress toward a transcendent goal, it is important to note, does _not_ pit the human at the center of this model, for there is nothing but the Absolute always, or Spirit. This is _not_ an individual, agented enterprise; it can operate fully without our involvement and does not need us to move to its unity.&#x20;

Accelerationist thinking certainly agrees with the baseline premise that progress can be understood through a formulaic process. They agree that higher order forms (i.e. synthesis) arrives through a movement from an original form (i.e. thesis) to its negation (i.e. antithesis) and then beyond that negation. For this reason, Hegel's model can generally be very helpful when attempting to organize how Accelerationism _progress_ is viewed; however, there are few substantive differences.&#x20;

Wherein Hegel's Dialectic progress does not move backwards ever, this can in fact occur in Accelerationism, and is the dialectical direction taken by a Decelerator, or when Accelerator fails in resisting the influences of _decelerant_ forces, i.e. "Decels". Additionally, the purpose and final goal behind what could be called the "Accelerationist Dialectic" is not dialectical unity but human evolution. This leads to the last and most important divergence of these models: Rather than view progress as an abstract that transpires regardless of human involvement, Accelerationist thought pits a _deliberate human_ _agent_ at the beginning of its "thesis"; this human then directs his agency not only _through_ the dialectic, but also towards speeding the dialectical process up, to _accelerate_ the moving through of the formula.&#x20;

This _agency_ that the Accelerationist thought applies to dialectics is influenced by Ludwig von Mises, an early 20th century Austrian economist.&#x20;

### Mises and _Agency_

Sitting at the center of Accelerationist agenda, then, is the autonomous, agency-filled teleologically-oriented subject -- one with preferences and purposes and goals, and additionally the capacity and the will and the knowledge to reach or acquire or achieve them; one who deliberately _chooses_ to make _purposeful_ movement _outward, toward,_ or _beyond_ to get them.&#x20;

Accelerationist thought aims, with clear purpose of evolutionary advancement in mind, to maximize both 1) the efficiency of execution -- i.e. accomplish goals in the shortest amount of time; as well as 2) the maximization of output, i.e. accomplish as many goals as possible. These tasks of these endeavors is a very _real,_ on-the-ground-human component, which major ACCEL influence Ludwig von Mises treats in his 1949 magnum opus, _Human Action_. Here, argues for a methodology based in praxeology, or the study of human agency and action -- to account for the efficiencies of the free market system.&#x20;

While being _the_ economist that, at long last, convinced the early Soviet Union that state-driven markets simply cannot work in practice (because there is no mechanism by which to measure value), Mises truly was more philosopher than economist: He was a philosopher of _human choice_; he understood at the most minute, mundane building block of society that "The general theory of choice and practice... is the science of every kind of human action. Choosing determines all human decisions. In making his choice man chooses not only between various material things and services. All human values are offered for option" (Mises 3). _Choice_, for Mises, then, was a snapshot of the human condition, that it more or less had human-like imperfections, "economics is a living thing - and to live implies both imperfection and change" -- he saw it to be the truest and purist form of value-placement; it captured an immediacy in signaling purpose or intent. He sated, "The modern theory of value widens the scientific horizon and enlarges the field of economic studies. Out of the political economy of the classical school emerges the general theory of human action, praxeology" (Mises 3).&#x20;

Mises was expansive and explosive in his range: He comprehensively took it upon himself to develop entire theories on catallactics, the theoretical method by which the free market reaches price and exchange ratios (Mises). He theoretically toppled the polylogism of Marx (Mises 5-6).&#x20;

Most of all though, even above his championing of the notion that there was only one societal economy of scale that worked: free market capitalism. Even beyond this, Mises is a hero for ACCEL in that he was a champion of the _individual human_ and their considered each singular person's agency when he, often singularly, went up against some of the most power economic institutions. Mises was a true accelerator.&#x20;

With the foundational process of Hegel and the praxeology of von Mises, Accelerationism advances forth, maximizing intelligence, optimizing agency, and efforting to secure our continued evolution. &#x20;
