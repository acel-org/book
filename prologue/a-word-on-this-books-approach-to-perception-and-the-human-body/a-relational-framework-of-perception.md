# A Relational Framework of Perception

### The Elusive History of Sensory Perception&#x20;

Human sensory perception, as an area of technical study, stands as one of the most discipline-ranging and historically attended-to research subjects in academic, clinical, and commercial fields. With scientific origins dating to 350BCE with Aristotle's treatise _De Anima_, the full scope of human's sensory perception has, for over two millennia, eluded humanity's manifold attempts to grasp its full mystery. And yet, as displayed by the 2021 Nobel Prize being awarded to two sensory perception researchers, our collective memetic curiosity is as sparked now as it ever has been (Aristotle; Freethink).&#x20;

And yet, despite this subject field being constantly reworked and reimagined -- theoretically, empirically, technologically -- humans are still only so much closer to providing our memetic repository a comprehensive, true, definitive, lasting theoretical model by which to understand our sensory faculties and their relational nature to affective stimuli.

### Building More Suitable Frameworks for Bodies-in-Worlds&#x20;

In fact, most of these efforts (save the work done by a handful of anthropologists) end up doing more harm than good, as their architects end up carelessly or unknowingly reifying a certain outdated, even dangerous theoretical framework, one that British mathematician Alfred North Whitehead termed the "Bifurcation of Nature”: the epistemological Cartesian-split between subjectivity and objectivity, nature and science (Whitehead). In remarkably ironic and damaging fashion to studies with _embodied experience_ (e.g. sensory perception), this bifurcation leaves even the most subjective-championing philosopher to have already accidentally pulled the agency out of their subject's body even before putting pen to to pad, pulled that body out of its _lifeworld_ (Husserl 24).&#x20;

For British anthropologist Gregory Bateson, this removal of agency, what he will call a _context --_ catalyzes a suicide _of meaning_, for, in his deployment of structural linguistics to draw out relationships between _content_ and _context_, he writes in his _Steps to an Ecology of Mind_, "the word only exists as such—only has “meaning”—in the larger context of the utterance, which again has meaning only in a relationship,” (Bateson 1972: 402). Bateson suggests then that _meaning_ (i.e. content), does not, in fact, have meaning -- is not _itself --_ until it comes into relation with the context in which it is placed. Indeed, being, without being _in relation to_ a world, is an utterly meaningless abstraction: it does not, _cannot_ exist as itself until it comes into relation with a world.&#x20;

Bateson's student and current professor at the University of Aberdeen, Timothy Ingold, extends this notion even further: “...information only exists thanks to the movement of the perceiver relative to his or her surroundings” (Ingold 18). In other words, while Bateson needs context for _meaning_ to exist; Ingold needs context for _information_ -- _any_ information _at all_ -- to exist. In this way, Ingold's notion of an “ecology of life” manifests as a “developmental system” that accounts for the “whole-organism-in-its-environment” -- this is all realized through emergent, affective relations (Ingold 10). Thus, to Ingold, understandings of the mind and its cognition, its understanding of itself, cannot be removed from environment, nor environment from mind.

While the holistic tone of this phenomenology -- of information, of perception, of relationality, of embodiment, and so on -- as propounded by these anthropologists may seem wholesome and hopeful in their dissolutions of rigid, residual Cartesian dualisms, the truth is that this theoretical model, as it must account for virtually every molecular-sized mobilization on its given material plane in every given moment -- more, as it must account for all lines of affect in that given space and time -- is, without exaggeration, nauseating in scale. Borrowing from the already labyrinthine Deleuze and Guattari, the body-with-world whose synergy geneates information-emergent realities through nearly infinite lines of perception is quite exciting to theorize upon from a distance; it is quite another to acquire that empirical evidence, as mapping five seconds of a body in motion could take years, or lifetimes.&#x20;

### The Multiplicitous Lines of Perception

Our five sense perceptions of sight, smell, sound, touch, and taste indeed seem to present coordinated aversion to being contained in theoretical models. First, it should be acknowledged that would be a lifetime's work even manually chasing down _one_ sense and its bewilderingly frenetic, unknown quantities of lines of perception -- each vibrating at varying magnitudes --  to and from no destination, simultaneously striking subadditive quantities and superadditive quantities, and shifting relational touchpoints across its topographical landscape (which is itself, as we'll see). And that was just one sense. We have five, and they are _all_ interconnected, creating exponentially more permutations.&#x20;

Such is our relational reality, our gift: the utterly complex, _integrated_ multi-systems that are our senses, numbered in five; in this framework, their affect cannot be said to be definitively unidirectional, bidirectional, or multidirectional, or a combination of two or all three; it is incomprehensibly difficult to parse the magnitudes of these affects' apart from on another, especially that they are all - in waking life, perpetually emergent multiplicities, exponentiating in permutational size any time they cross, which is, in fact, all the time, all at once, without pause. Even when we take no notice of the smaller magnitudes -- e.g. cars passing by in the background during a conversation -- we know that our senses do not shut off. Lines of perception everywhere forever.&#x20;

How sensory perception is continually delivered as a basic computational state machine is It is clear these senses are no mere deterministic state machine, no basic computational design, though that is how perception is most often delivered to our memetic repository. This is regrettable and misleading. Still, even more promise inherent in relational perception is that in these lines lies the potential to be manipulated. Should we effort ourselves in this direction, we may train these billions of trillions lines of perception, as has been proven possible. This -- that of focused and directed agency, adds still another level of complexity to the nature of sensory perception.&#x20;

### A Phenomenological Framework of Relationality

So it is that we have in our mode: An agent _embodi_ed who deliberately moves this body in relational dynamism with the material, spatial environment with which it is manifest; it is this affective-lines-of-perception dance they share together that thereby generates information that then enters the memetic repository.

It is no far stone to throw to see how beautifully, how seamlessly the contextual framing of this embodied agent, cognizant of their relational dynamism manifest with material surroundings, fits --with asymptotic precision -- sensory perception studies. In many ways, this description laid forth above is intuitively what we know perception to be and what not to be: At baseline, we know that perception cannot occur without some semblance of perceiving body; a brain and a central nervous system are requirements to process stimuli from which to synthesize intelligence.&#x20;

Nor can perception occur without stimuli. Indeed, perception cannot occur without one or the other, and it certainly cannot occur without either. In other words, to even meet the bare minimum justifications to make novel claims on sensory perception, one _must_ treat both the content - e.g. the body - _and_ the context - e.g. material space - , and they must treat them as having equal value. Indeed, life itself -- a notion that, for Ingold, encompasses both the organism and its environment -- is “not a compound of two things, but an indivisible totality” (Ingold 2000: 19), which, via Bateson, operates in a sort of constant information-generation feedback loop (Bateson 1972: 403-04).

Thus exists our theoretical grounding of perception for SpaceBrains: a framework that will open, rather than close; contain, rather than control. This model will offer an supportive ground from which Accelerationism's goals for humanity may lift off, grow the relational possibilities between what embodiment means and what spaces those bodies might manifest themselves in, all the while its lines of perception dissolving the rigid structures between body and not-body -- all toward the Energy Machines. Before we arrive there, however, we must next build a theoretical base for embodiment.&#x20;
