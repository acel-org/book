# The Four Orientations of Mutability

In the following chapters, this book will, in alignment with its intended trajectory for human evolution, set forth an intrepid and courageous schema for the future of our species. This proposition is framed as a necessary existential "jump" for humankind, one that we hope to survive and continue our evolutionary journey. Below are laid out the _four_ _orientations --_ adopted at the individual and collective level -- for humanity to attend to as we inevitably move closer to the point where we must execute this jump. By "orientations", it is meant theoretical virtue systems by which humans may arrange and align their inner worlds; for, as will be shown, a different world from the familiar is coming -- it is best to be prepared for this unprecedented type of shift.&#x20;

Surely, should one arrive to this shift having been inattentive to the below virtue systems, failing to develop the required mental framework for new realities, it will have been a short fate, indeed. &#x20;

## Ontology must:

### Be Mutable

#### Guiding question: What does it mean to embody a mutable ontology? What does a pliable relationship with your core being look like ?&#x20;

A _mutable_ ontology for any individual means that they are able to destabilize, reassess, rearrange, and redeploy -- however often is necessary -- the core nature of their being, their existence. Any set of assumptions or driving ideas they have of their existence, what makes them "them", is malleable and remains open to change. This is being light-footed regarding your what your _self_ is, as this may be required to change in order to survive.&#x20;

A caveat here is that, for some untrained individuals, this skill may risk their sanity, their ability to stay grounded in any existence whatsoever. Any given human, should they be required to mutate their ontological situation in order to survive, must learn ways to, during periods of the fluctuating self, stay grounded and centered in the _relationality_ of the world.&#x20;

### Be Relational

#### Guiding Question: What does it mean to embody a relational ontology? What does a relational existence between body and the space it shares look like?&#x20;

Recall Bateson's theoretical applications of content and context: If ontology is the _content_, then relationality is the _context_. Because ontology, that of being, cannot, _in any way_, be approached in isolation _from a relationship_ to the space shared with the being -- Yuasa Yasuo has said, “…a human being cannot exist as a life in the cosmos unless he or she coexists with other life," -- it then follows that the most consistent and stable piece of any existence is, not existence, but the immediate lines of relation that existence has with the phenomenal space it occupies (Kasulis, Ames, and Dissanayake 1993: 348). This also recalls Dan Dennett's quip of the ant climbing up the grass stalk where it can more easily get into a sheep's stomach and reproduce: "The benefit is not to the reproductive prospects of the ant but the reproductive prospects of the fluke," where the fluke is the ant walking up the grass stalk for apparently no reason it has decided on itself (Dennett). In other words, rather than the meaningful connection of the ant to its lifeworld lie somewhere between it and the destination the ant is going (i.e. the environment), it is the ant's connection to the memetic line of relation _itself_ --i.e. the _fluke,_ the _meme itself_ -- that matters, that brings value, to one of the two in relation.  Dennett takes this even further by saying the ant isn't the protagonist in this story if we measure that by value accrual; it is the _meme_ who is the protagonist, who gains the most benefit from all of this.&#x20;

Note that the space is also in constant flux; we see this by looking with our eyes for only just a moment. The maintaining of sanity during ontological shifts thus stems from grounding oneself in the consistent-in-changing memetic lines of relationality between yourself and the space that space shares with you.&#x20;

## Faith must:&#x20;

### Be Total

Insofar as efforts are effective: Mutability requires an undivided, total faith that one's efforts to transmute their content are or will be effective; in other words, that they will achieve their aim. This is a secular faith. Should faith fall short, there will be no "ontological jump", which preexists any "existential jump". Ontological mutability truly does require a leap of faith.&#x20;

### Have Point of Origin &#x20;

A worthy departure: An individual must have a worthy reason to deliberately choose to deploy their agency towards initiating an alteration, mutation; to actionize an evolution of their corporeal, ontological relationship with the world. The individual must be have faith that what they are moving towards is preferable to what they are leaving behind. The point of origin provides the purpose of faith, what spurs one to _move_.

## Phenomenology must:

### Be reconfigured: Lifeworld = Organism + Lines of Relations&#x20;

Traditionally, the lifeworld is theoretically composed of the interplay between organism and environment. This is wrong, and will have devastating consequences if not rearranged for the upcoming "existential jump". Remember, for Bateson, the nature of  the "context" (e.g. sentence) is to stabilize and spatially open meaning for the "content" (e.g. word) -- the context determines the content. And while our content to this point has existed sufficiently within an environmental context, we are changing; and so our context must change as well.&#x20;

That was as individuals are now become _mutable content_ -- that is, we require our content to be alterable by nature --  we now require a context that is minimally determinant of our content. For, while the environment may have once been appropriate for our context, this is no longer the case -- our increase in mutability is an increase in agency, and in the former phenomenological setup we would remain too static, too _unmutable_.&#x20;

Our lifeworld of course remains a shared exchange; but, this is now an exchange between, not organism and environment, but organism and _relationality_ itself -- we and the lines of relation connecting us to the space we fill.&#x20;

Being, without being _in relation to_ a world, is an utterly meaningless abstraction: it does not, _cannot_ exist as itself until it comes into _the lines of relation_ with a world. Organizing one's ontology around the lines of relation encourages a more malleable relationship between the two. And thus it is that the new human will find its grounding in the fluctuations of the universe; much as the Energy Machine one day will.&#x20;

## Agency must:

### Be guided by faith

Implicit in the notion of mutability is agency. The alterable existence does not become so -- become _itself_ -- until an agent is present to alter it. Agents, by nature, _do_; they act and they _alter_; they produce an outcome that they have faith will come to pass because of their choosing to act. Therefore, an agent chooses to act and alter things because he or she has a faith that it will have some sort of outcome.&#x20;

This means that implicit in the notion of agency is faith; faith preexists agency, just as agency preexists mutability. &#x20;

### Be teleologically-oriented

Teleology, by definition, is the understanding of any particular phenomena primarily by the purpose it serves, e.g. the teleology of a knife is to cuts things." For Accelerationism, the teleology of agency is to asymptotically maximize agency to the nth degree and complete the evolution of humanity. All accelerant agency is aimed teleologically towards towards this goal. Such is the _purpose of agency._&#x20;

### Be self-produced&#x20;

In the transfiguration of one's ontology, from the mundane to the transcendent, agency must be produced by own's own will. Agency is not attendant on other beings or entities. Those who accelerate give themselves, to recall Turner, the “power to produce themselves” -- and they do. They produce their agency; they produce their purpose; they transmutate themselves. &#x20;
