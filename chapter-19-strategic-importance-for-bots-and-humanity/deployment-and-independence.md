# Deployment and Independence

The rapid deployment of bots into space is necessary. If it is delayed, regulatory and political constraints -- by those with vested interests -- , might stifle them. Quick exportation ensures that bots can be free and work to their set exploration mandate. Such a deployment should be followed with giant reusable space launch systems (SLS) that are contained in themselves and thus reduce reliance on Earth-based resources. These systems ensure a persistent supply of bots in space, ready to perform their designed tasks.

Therefore, bots operating in space must achieve self-sufficiency at a very high level. They should be supplied with the ability to source and process local resources on asteroids, moons, and planets. This feature minimizes their dependence on supplies developing from Earth and makes long missions more feasible.&#x20;

Importantly, the concept on In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), which extracts water, minerals, and other materials from surroundings for the bots has to be utilized. Using this concept, NASA has plans to back up a sustained human presence on the Moon with its lunar exploration agenda.

Besides this, the machines should be self-repairing and maintenance-efficient; advanced robotics and AI will allow them to diagnose and fix issues on their own, making them operate much longer without Earth's support. For instance, The European Space Agency equipped its ExoMars rover with the function of self-maintenance, thanks to which it would have the possibility to continue its mission even in case of mechanical failures.&#x20;

Therefore, it is important for the bots to be able to harness solar power and other forms of renewable energy in space. Any long-term performance in unmanned or hostile environments would require bots to be equipped with an energy generation and storage system. Solar panels on spacecraft, as can be witnessed with the Juno probe studying Jupiter --far from the sun-- offer a reliable energy source, proving it possible to use renewable energy in space exploration.
