# Transition to SpaceBrains

The transition to SpaceBrain is not only a technological evolution but a deep philosophic journey. It is the boldest venture humans have ever taken to rise above their biological legacy and to change the very meaning of what it is to be human. Transition would thus institute a new life in which consciousness, unfettered by rotting flesh, finds its place in a silicon sanctuary promising reduced mortality and cognitive enhancement.

It needs to start with the very basic question: what does it mean to be human? Philosophers, scientists, and poets have been wrestling for centuries with this question. René Descartes famously declared, "Cogito, ergo sum" – "I think, therefore I am." By this declaration, he underscored that consciousness itself is paramount in defining existences. It is in the SpaceBrain project, however, that an idea has been taken to its most extreme possible conclusion: that a preservation or enhancement of our "thinking selves" may realize a new kind of life, free from the constraints and limitations of our mortal bodies.

The decision to become a SpaceBrain is driven apart by the longing for more life, stronger minds, and contributing toward the cosmic journey of humanity. When, as part of the normal life cycle, biological life reaches its end, individuals have two options in front of them: either merge into this new form of existence or succumb to death. That choice mirrors man's eternal quest for immortality, one that has given rise to a great number of mythological, religious, and scientific enterprises.

This is in no way just physical--it brings with itself immense psychological and philosophical changes. People, by necessity, will have to adapt to a different line of thinking and existing as enhanced mental powers and stretched life are implicit in this transition. Identity and purpose need to be redefined as there is a relinquishing of the biological body, to exist within the pod of silicon. This could be compared to the fully developed metamorphosis of the caterpillar into a butterfly by shedding off its old form to attain a new and improved form.

Elon Musk, one of the most outspoken proponents of human biology interfacing with technology, said, "I think we are already 'cyborgs'... your phone and your computer are extensions of you." What this means is that biologicals are already trending toward technological augmentations. The SpaceBrain project represents the last evolution of this path: That seat of our consciousness--the brain--is preserved and enhanced by technology, thus achieving a new form of existence.&#x20;

A SpaceBrain requires a transition in several steps, each crafted with utmost care for the complete preservation, protection, and integration of the brain into its new environment. First is a thorough medical check, which features advanced imaging techniques, gene analysis, and neurological evaluations. This is to ensure that the brain is a healthy and viable candidate for the transfer process.

Subsequently, prep procedures to enhance the strength of the brain cells and their function are undertaken. These will include gene therapy in case neural pathways need repair or upgrading. They also include biocompatible material implants for holding up and propping whatever neural structures needs support and introducing nanobots for maintaining the integrity of structure of the brain and keeping it safe from unwanted external agents; all this is to put the brain into best conditions for the transition.

This is followed by the surgically delicate removal of the brain from the body, which requires highly specialized neurosurgeons and very advanced surgical technologies. The carefully removed brain is immediately kept in a specially designed unit that keeps the brain in conditions optimal for its survival later.

Finally, the preserved brain is relocated to the silicon pod, where it will lie indefinitely. This provides a controlled environment for the appropriate delivery of food and oxygen supplies, in such a manner that it maintains the health and functionality of the brain.

The last step in the transition is the integration of the brain into the global SpaceBrain network. Integration will empower the brain to hook up with other space brains and digital systems for seamless communication and collaboration. Its sensory-motor functions are therefore remapped to interface with a plethora of external devices and sensors, opening up new ranges of perception and interaction.

Philosophically, this transition raises deep questions as to the nature of identity, consciousness, and existence.

If our bodies are left behind and just our consciousness is within a silicon pod, do we remain ourselves? The question gives the impression of relating to the theory put across by John Locke, an English philosopher, who argued that personal identity is not in the substance of the body but rather in consciousness. So long as our memories, thoughts, and self-awareness abide, based on this view, we stay the same persons even when our physical appearance changes.

There are also significant social and ethical considerations with the transition to a SpaceBrain. It hits at conventional concepts of life and death, possibly avoiding the finality of mortality. but doing so in such a manner is not free from costs and sacrifices, most notably an immediate loss of the physical body and probably an absolutely different relation to the world. The consequences emerging from these implications are issues to be dealt with internally by each person facing such a deep decision.&#x20;

The transition to becoming a SpaceBrain is, in a word, multi-dimensional: medical, physical, psychological, and philosophical. It gives an extended life expectancy, enriched cognitive abilities, and the opportunity to participate in the cosmic journey of humanity. Such a transformation from biological into artificial existence is a huge step forward in human evolution, opening vast opportunities for personal and collective development. Carl Sagan wrote, "Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known." In the process of moving beyond our biological flesh and into a new life form, The SpaceBrains project challenges us to find that in ourselves.
