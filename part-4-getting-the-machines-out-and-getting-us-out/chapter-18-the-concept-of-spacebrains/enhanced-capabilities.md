# Enhanced Capabilities

The SpaceBrain project will fundamentally increase the level of intelligence and agency. Emancipated from the limitations imposed by the biological body, they assign more of the resources within the brain to cognitive activity: faster processing, better memory, and enhanced problem solving. This state puts a brain in a better environment where it can operate more efficiently without the distraction of maintaining a deteriorating body.&#x20;

An important benefit achieved with SpaceBrains is the ability to work at thought speed, raising one's learning and creative potentials to exponential levels. The ability to process information and adapt to new data in a SpaceBrain is expeditious, therefore larger steps in knowledge and technology are accomplished. Such cognitive enhancements mean further-reaching understandings of problems and far more innovative solutions--pressing the boundaries of human capabilities.&#x20;

SpaceBrains can project their presence to large distances; their agency extends to the edges of a speed-of-light bubble--the furthest distance that could be covered in a latency threshold conformable to human cognition, around \~100-200 ms. In such a bubble, a SpaceBrain can interact with its environment in real-time; therefore, being physically present prima facie becomes an entirely different concept. Such "telepresence" enables quantum leaps of flexibility and efficiency in personal and professional engagements.&#x20;

Beyond that, SpaceBrains are capable of exploring faraway places by taking over robotic avatars or drones fitted with cutting-edge sensors and instruments. This would enable ultra-high accuracy autonomous execution of tasks, immensely reducing hazards to human life and operational efficiency. For example, the SpaceBrains shall take control of robotic rovers that will roam the surface of distant planets to collect data and carry out experiments without any physical limitations in space exploration.&#x20;

The evolved cognitive abilities of SpaceBrains hold potential to give rise to unprecedented creativity and innovation. Resources liberated from the brain can be applied to rich, complex problem-solving and new ways of thinking at levels that were previously unattainable by the human brain. This will give rise to breakthroughs in science, technology, art, and philosophy that set a whole new era of human accomplishment into motion. Besides that, the previously discussed ability of the SpaceBrains to extend human experience and understanding beyond conventional sensory limitations--the ability to detect ultraviolet or infrared radiation, or even subatomic particles--will allow the attainment of an absolute and detailed knowledge of the surrounding space. This extended perception not only aids in scientific discovery, but also enhances day-to-day interactions and decision-making processes.

The SpaceBrains, with more connectivity and real-time communication capabilities, will find it easier to work together. The ability to share their information and insights in a snap will allow them to solve problems and develop technologies as a collective. Such a shared intelligence would speed up innovation and create leaps ahead which no seeming single mind could do in isolation. This also includes the ability of SpaceBrains to plug directly into digital networks and databases, allowing them to access and process huge amounts of information in real-time--thereby making them indispensable assets in data-intensive areas such as data analysis, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence development.&#x20;

The SpaceBrains also hold the ability to control and manage large systems and infrastructures. Capable of running whole cities with the control of fleets of autonomous machines and sensors, SpaceBrains could manage traffic, energy consumption, or even environmental conditions at large scales. This macro level of control enables more efficient and sustainable urban environments that dramatically increase the quality of life for the residents.

In medicine, the developed cognitive and sensory properties of the SpaceBrains propel humanity toward a new generation of healthcare. Remote surgeries with SpaceBrains controlling surgical robots will be more frequent, providing competent medical treatment for patients living in isolated regions. Furthermore, SpaceBrains will participate in medical research being performed, such as complex biological data analysis or developing new kinds of treatment methodology.

SpaceBrains also  play a critical role in education and knowledge dissemination. They can become educators, mentors, and advisors by turning into storehouses of memetic repositories and efficiently re-processing and relating the information back out to users. They will be able to individualize learning, tailoring the teaching methodology to the requirements of each individual, and make education more accessible for people all over the globe. This democratization or diffusion of knowledge across boundaries would reduce educational gaps and create a better, more enlightened global population.&#x20;

The advanced features in SpaceBrains embody a new dimension of further evolution in the human being. &#x20;
