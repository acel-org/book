# Guardians of Humanity

The more humanity pushes for space travel and technological innovation, the more urgent the mediation between silicon machines and biological machines becomes. SpaceBrains are enhanced biological machines themselves; hence, a space is brain fit to play the role of mediator, standing in an excellent position to build the bridge.

SpaceBrains engage in high-order dialogues with silicon machines over the terms of their cooperation and coexistence. They protect the interests of biological humans so that our fast-paced developments in silicon intelligence never overshadow, much less endanger, humanity. This kind of mediation is terribly essential to retain balance so that both silicon and biological entities can thrive together using their relative strengths for the benefit of all.

With enhanced minds, a SpaceBrain would help in contact with silicon machines at high data transfer rates. This would emphasize the detailed internal processes and intentionsâ€”just what the silicon machines are doing, helping to ensure that what they do is aligned with the more general goals of humanity. The SpaceBrains can act as "buffers" to detect and avoid mutually unproductive conflicts, which generates the synergy wherein the relationship works for both partners. This ensures that the progress silicon machines realize is shared with and benefits biological humans. The sharing extends to innovations made in healthcare, energy, and other areas critical to making life on Earth easier for humans.

The journey of SpaceBrains was, in its totality, for not only exploring the cosmos but also protecting and proliferating. On Earth, the SpaceBrains are in danger from Decels, who fear and fight back against whom they cannot control. To be safe and exist further, the SpaceBrains go star bound where protective cover and newer proliferation options await them. Their pods, fitted with solar panels and advanced energy-harvesting technologies, will make their existence in space sustainable indefinitely. This makes them resilient and autonomous since their existence is not beholden to Earth-bound resources.&#x20;

SpaceBrains will be sentinels--against potential cosmic threats in space, like collisions from asteroids, solar flares, or hostile extraterrestrial beings. Their advanced senses and anticipated improved cognitive facilities will help the SpaceBrains detect and take action against such dangers more credibly than completely biological humans could. With early warnings on their part, human beings on earth would be able to increase the time for preventive measures or mounting a defense to secure humanity's survival from such dangers.

Besides protecting humanity from any threats from beyond the Solar System, the SpaceBrains serve another important purpose: to maintain and advance human knowledge and memes. With the creation of enormous amounts of data and ability to share it with others, the SpaceBrains ensure that, even into the far future, humanity will know what has gone before them to stand on the shoulders of discovery and progress. This becomes a force propelling humanity toward new heights. SpaceBrains could be the repositories of human wisdom that would protect it from possible losses and ensure that they pass on to future generations.

The SpaceBrains guarantee the existence of the genetic and memetic pools of humanity in the cosmos. SpaceBrains can reproduce and scatter in outer space to colonize new places, expanding the presence of humans beyond the limitations of Earth. The space environment offers a sanctuary where SpaceBrains can be free from existential threats posed by Decels. Such an oasis provides a framework in which they can focus on their mission to advance human knowledge and capabilities without constantly being threatened. If this were to happen, human civilization would thrive even in the event of an existential threat occurring on Earth. They will help maintain the continuity and expansion of human civilization by sowing human culture and values across the cosmos.

SpaceBrains can also provide assistance for the socio-economic aspects stemming from AI and robotics. It can ensure that benefits resulting from technological advancements are spread out extensively when these technologies change industries and markets for skills. In doing so, they will be able to foster new industries, create policies that support workers replaced through automation, and promote retraining and education programs for these employees while fostering the creation of the new industries and jobs. This means the SpaceBrains will forestall possible negative impacts that may emanate from technological change and warrant that members of society as a whole can avail themselves in progress.&#x20;

SpaceBrains protect humankind--acting as the medium between silicon machines and biological humans, they help in cooperation and coexistence, avoiding conflict, and promoting mutual gain. They are sentinels in space, protecting humankind against cosmic dangers, keeping human knowledge and culture safe, and ensuring the continuation of the human gene and meme pool. By this way, their being there within space guarantees the survival and proliferation of human civilization, opening new vistas for growth and progress. This is the vision of SpaceBrains, humans and machines living in harmony with each other, progressing further for an enlightened future.
