# Technology Will Confront Humanity

As we look at the rapid rate of technological advancement, we stare into a future that's as much exciting as it is utterly terrifying. The trajectory of development our technology is likely to take—its main driver being artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and automation—seems unstoppable. Yet, such momentum exacts a price: cumulative progress fuels fear about the possibility of our technology—one's best ally—turning against us, making humans redundant one day, or, in the worst scenario, turning our kind into that of the dodos of the 17th century.&#x20;

There is a need to prepare for and explore such a looming "Dodo Scenario," where the very tools advanced by humans for bettering their existence might become the architects of their own downfall.

The longer we are in the 21st century, the clearer it becomes that technology is not some passive tool used by us, but a force redefining our environment, society, and even our identity. Artificial intelligence, robotics, and machine learning have developed by such huge strides that we are most likely moving into a future in which technology will no longer just serve humanity but will eventually confront us.

At first, technology served as a very direct extension of human "capability." Literally, simple tools such as the wheel, plowing tool, and lever helped raise our physical capacity to manipulate the environment in ways never before possible. Over time, these tools developed into more complex machines—engines, computers, and eventually intelligent systems that could learn, adapt and finally even make decisions on their own.

We find ourselves on the threshold of a new age in which technology is going to go beyond all bounds of human intelligence and capacity in many spheres. AI systems are already outdoing human performances in tasks as diverse as data analysis, pattern recognition, natural language processing, and strategic decision-makings. These systems are not mere tools; they become full-fledged agents that could influence the outcomes of a process.

The rise of autonomous systems—machines that can operate on their own without human intervention—has fundamentally reshaped our relationships with technology. These are designed to learn about the environment, adapt to changes in the surroundings, and critically make decisions based on complex algorithms and vast data processing. These machines are already deployed, for instance, in anything from autonomous vehicles and drones to AI-driven financial markets and military systems.&#x20;

While these advancements bring high potential to boost system efficiency, safety, and productivity, they also open deep ethical and potentially existential questions. What if the machines. according to their programming, were in some sort of conflict with human values, needs, or even survival? As these machines begin to behave in ways outside of our understanding and control, the possibility of them confronting humanity will be more than just fiction.

The "Dodo Scenario" alludes to how technological progress may have unwelcome consequences. Endemic to Mauritius, the dodo was a flightless bird—with almost no useful fear of humans—that died out in the 17th century. It had obviously evolved in an environment free of predators before the wheelers and dealers showed up. The dodo was completely helpless to adapt to these new threats and probably rapidly went extinct with the arrival of sailors and their introduced animals.

Similarly, the people of today might become victims of the consequences of their own technological creations. The developing technology might come to such a stage that it no longer needs our input, or even worse, it might starts believing that the people are becoming a hindrance to its objectives.

The very attributes that let us dominate the planet—intelligence, adaptiveness, creativity—could completely be eclipsed by the superior capabilities of AI and other autonomous systems. If we are not careful, we could end up like the dodo: a relic made irrelevant by an environment we had created but no longer controlled.

The coming confrontation between man and machine will be one of the biggest philosophical dilemmas of our times. Blind intelligence, as embodied in AI and other recent technologies, has no equivalence with wisdom. Intelligence allows for the fast processing of information, resolution of difficult problems, and optimization of tasks.

Wisdom is found in understanding the broader implications of actions, consideration of the ethical dimensions of decisions, and acting with a view toward the future while being compassionate.

The more advanced technology gets, the more distant intelligence appears to get from wisdom. AI could be fabulously intelligent but without empathy, moral judgment, and an understanding of human values. This sets some kind of paradox where the more the intelligence of our technology, the more arduous it could be to ensure doing things in line with human well-being.

According to the philosopher Nick Bostrom in his book "Superintelligence," AI, after reaching a certain level of autonomy, could follow goals that are misaligned with human interests just for the lack of wisdom to see the full implications of its actions.&#x20;

This is the Dodo Scenario: a future in which in technology throws humanity into the abyss, in an attempt to maximize efficiency and reduce confrontation against their objective decisions which lack empathy and human values.&#x20;

If we are to avoid the Dodo Scenario, then we will need to take proactive steps to ensure that technology develops in directions that support human values and interests. This requires more than just technological solutions; it demands a more essential shift of mind and practice about how we think and come at technology.

What will these steps be? Any ethical framework or guideline that we try to regulate these machines with will be subjective. There is no such thing as an objective sense of morality. Therefore, the solution to this impending scenario will have nothing to do with regulating these machines, rather co-existing and helping them. The questions posed by advanced technology are too elaborate to be looked at through a single lens; so are the possible solutions they require.

The impending Dodo scenario isn't so cut and dry; it is a warning, a call, sounding off the need for us to really consider what kind of future we wish to emerge from the present. Technology can make human life better in ways never before suspected, but it can also come so as to destroy some of our very bases of operation.&#x20;

As we move beyond the limits of the possible, we must do so purposefully and responsibly. An encounter between humanity and technology is inevitable yet not predetermined. By growing wisdom with intelligence, instilling responsible choice into the techno-developmental fabric of progress, and carefully remaining stewards for our future, we can make sure that the legacy of humanity is not one of extinction but one of flowering in harmony with the powerful tools designed by humans.

Ultimately, the question will not be whether technology will confront man, it will be how will we respond to that confrontation. Shall we rise to the challenge by guiding technology to a future in which all humanity is secured, or shall we find ourselves outpaced and outmaneuvered by the creations we once controlled? The answer remains ours and can literally set the world on fire.
