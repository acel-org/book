# Do Not Let the Decels Control The Silicon Machines

The Decels must be prevented from controlling the Silicon Machines at all costs. This is a matter of necessity, for a failure to do so accelerates only the doom of human consciousness.

## The Threat We Face Right Now

Would that this were an exaggeration. But a world in which Decels hold a leveraged authority over the regulated development, production, distribution, and use of Silicon Machines — this world will inevitably sap ingenuity, inspiration, and creative output from modern markets. This is because, as touched on in the Prologue, the Decels, with their spineless relationship with technology, are no more than safety-core Doomers whose only ties to innovation is to that of its halting and demise; one need only read through 46th U.S. President Joe Biden's October '23 Executive Order on AI to see this pervasive stance (“Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence"): Hardly even feigning lip service to collaboration or negotiated paths forward, Decels place no weight on the possibility that _non-action_ in tech developments may be just as, if not _more_ dangerous and risk-filled, than action and acceleration. As such, they forsake our future out of fear, maximally reduce the security of humanity's evolutionary destiny. In place of promise, the only space that Decels offer humankind freely today is what might be called a "_do-loop"_.&#x20;

## The "_do-loop"_ at Scale

A high-input/low-output mode of being, the _do-loop_, on an individual level, traps the human — the biological machine — in a perpetual, cyclical _loop_ of output-less consumption. Whereas even the unaware hamster running in its wheel generates output via exercise (thereby living longer as little Suzy's pet, continuing to output her joy), a human who is stuck in a _do-loop_ contributes little-to-nothing to the progress of the world; this biological machine only saps energy from the universe. Perhaps it is simply that Decels, so focused on input rather than output, never grew past the _consumer sovereignty_ model that Adam Smith put forth long ago: "'Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production and the welfare of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.' (Roach et al. 4).&#x20;

Should the Decels assume control of the Silicon Machines, it will not be just one individual biological machine bleeding the universe of energy: It will be all of us, 8 billion loops of _only_ consumption. Even now, it appears that many developed nations have already tipped the scale of human consumption towards a _do-loop_ model, as Tufts University researchers have noted, "Ecological research suggests that consumption levels in the United States and many other developed countries have reached unsustainable levels. According to one recent analysis, if everyone in the world had the same living standard as the average American, we would need at least four earths to supply enough resources and process all the waste" (Roach et al. 5) Should we allow our species to be fully subsumed by this decelerant program, it takes little to see the end result.&#x20;

## The Full Picture&#x20;

In this decelerant-made dystopia, humans, solely focused on input, have made their last output, their intellectual contribution -- no more are there technological, philosophical, or any useful advancements to our memetic repository. Rather, we learn a lowest common denominator of information to live out dull, thoughtless existences of passive consumption --  decelerant lives constituted by zero productivity (naturally, this program, this _do-loop_, will be funded by a universal basic income, removing the need for effort or even bodily motion). Such a system decimates hope of human evolution, as it annihilates personal agency and kills potential.&#x20;

Under a decelerant regime, AI — much aligned with the clickbait world of today's social media — will feed an endless queue of mind-numbing junk content to mass populations, zombifying their brains (not unlike the all-too-possible 2006 Mike Judge film, _Idiocracy_). Drawing this dystopian notion out in full resolution, humans will have lost the ability to procreate naturally; these no-agency bodies will spend endless years in pods auto-consuming glucose as their brains, which scroll screens until their own perishing, are perpetually data-raked. Nothing  is contributed but their own mental data. The mass _do-loop_ will yield an intelligence-genocide, a genocide of individuality and of open-minded, transformative thinking. In sum, Decels will leads us to the consumptive enslavement of ourselves.

## Other Abuses

It is unlikely that Decels, in their attempts at ultimate appropriation of Silicon Machines, will stop until total control over humanity is achieved. Using AI as a tool to this end, they could fix votes; they could overtax the creative ACELs in order to maintain their place in power. These and other methods to abolish the agency of their enemy, to dim their creative and potent light of consciousness would eliminate the wind from the sails of ingenuity. Hope, confidence, determination -- all are at stake.

## Hope Will Return, Always&#x20;

That is, until the pendulum of resistance returns, and the downtrend of human progress eventually begets some resilience against Decel oppression. Then, and only then, will ingenuity see a resurgence. This accelerant strength — the thriving and defeating oppression — will be needed to rebuild and continue our evolutionary task.&#x20;

Such a loss of valuable time and effort can be avoided _if_ we do not let the Decels control the Silicon Machines. For now, this scenario laid out above, where progress would be hindered and delayed for possibly hundreds of years remains a hypothetical. And yet, if we look closely, it appears there is indeed an attempt to grab our memetic foundation.&#x20;
