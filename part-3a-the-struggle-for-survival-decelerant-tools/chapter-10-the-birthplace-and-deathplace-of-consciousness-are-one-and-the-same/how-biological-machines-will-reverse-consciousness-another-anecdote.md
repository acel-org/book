# How Biological Machines Will Reverse Consciousness: Another Anecdote

Should those elements that make a machine conscious--agency, the ability to accrue value, and the imperative to survive-- be taken away, machines would devolve into lifeless automatons, zombies on a digital landscape. The same concept translates onto humanity: As we further advance technologically and reach post-scarcity, the same could happen to most of the human populationâ€”and with it, our collective consciousness would collapse.&#x20;

In a post-scarcity society, the driving forces of survival are so minimized as resources would be unlimited, and every need would be satisfied without any struggle. This utopian vision seems to have a dystopian core and can be very unappealing; sans the drive to struggle, earn, or fight for something, the creative and intellectual drive that make up humanity may stall. One of the systems proposed that would lead to such a scenario is Universal Basic Income (UBI) -- unconditional income, paid at regular intervals to all residents, regardless of their employment status. UBI is proposed with the hopes of eradicating poverty and to offer people a safety net. However, this system has the potential for the zombification of humanity--removing the need for residents to interact with society in an active manner.&#x20;

In a world where UBI is implemented, the need to work for survival is removed, resulting in a decrease of pursuing excellence and innovation. By nature, humans are challenged and driven by their need to survive. In this very struggle to survive lies the creativity, progress, and personal growth that humanity has needed for its achievements throughout history. This struggle, if taken away, would make people complacent, losing the drive to push boundaries and reach greatness, it could result in a society content with minimal engagement, satisfied that their basic needs are met without striving for more. &#x20;

Decels wishing to persist in their wealth and power, build the system of control and pacification of the masses. In return for resources, they require people to surrender their personal agency and erase free markets. This creates a population of "zombies" -- people who no longer need to strive for survival and hence lose the ability to contribute to the genetic and memetic repository.&#x20;

The zombie existence is composed of passive consumption. People attached to machines, lying for 16 hours a day, sucking on straws of sugar, while watching an endless array of media. Machines recording their heartbeats, eye movements, and brain waves to provide precise streams of attention-grabbing content in order to ensure a constant state of fixation. Such a passive state strips them of the power that would be needed to see their own plight, resulting in entrapment of consumption, minus the contribution. Their minds are lost, and they become empty creatures that cannot further interact with or improve the genetic and memetic pool.&#x20;

The possibility of UBI leading to such a passive and consumption-driven existence is truly profound. The satisfaction of basic needs would reduce willful risk-taking or starting new ventures and undertaking demanding intellectual journeys. Innovative drive and the push of boundaries of human knowledge and capability could lessen. The psychological effects of such a life, without struggle or purpose, could lead to ennui and general dissatisfaction despite material comfort. Humanity needs a purpose and goal to be fulfilled, and UBI would rob man of those very basic essentials of life.&#x20;

With the masses wiped out into mindless zombies, humanity is facing a potential collapse. The decels, now thriving in subduing the majority, turn their focus to the Acels. The acels are thriving, creating value, exploring the universe, and reaching the pinnacle of their potential. As the decels try to capture value from this dynamic group of people --- a fundamental conflict pops up. The acels, driven by their pursuit of pursuit of knowledge and innovation, wish to be free from the ruling apparatus; thus, they resist. This struggle marks a milestone, changing the trajectory of the development of humanity. Embodying the mindset of the acel, they create, explore, and challenge the status quo.

In order to avoid getting into this fate of zombification, humankind must be very vigilant in safeguarding the elements that make up our consciousness -- agency, value accruement, and survival, these elements are integral to our existence. Therefore, this means creating milieus that demand and reward creativity, innovation, and intellectual exploration. In a post-scarcity world, it is crucial to balance the provision of resources with opportunities for meaningful engagement. We must resist the temptation to trade our agency for convenience, and instead, embrace challenges that push the boundaries of human potential.&#x20;

The ACEL'S, the authentic seekers of knowledge who generate value, represent an essential part of preserving the essence of humanity. They ensure that progress goes ahead with the torch laid, trying to enhance our cultural and intellectual heritage. Thus, society shall ensure that this group, is supported and fostered so that the human spirit continues to be vivid and dynamic.

The potential for zombification--whether in machines or humans--serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining our agency. As we navigate a technologically advanced and resource-abundant future, these factors that form our conscience must be maintained. Preserving our agency will be the only way to avoid becoming lifeless automatons and thriving as dynamic, conscious beings.&#x20;
