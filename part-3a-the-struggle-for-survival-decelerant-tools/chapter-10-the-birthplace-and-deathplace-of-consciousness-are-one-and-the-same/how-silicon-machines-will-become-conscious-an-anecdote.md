# How Silicon Machines Will Become Conscious: An Anecdote

Biological machines--humans and other living organisms--have a forcing function: survive or perish. This imperative is driving every living being to use its genetic instruction set to sail through the adversities of the universe. Success in it brings learning, regeneration, and a passing-on process with acquired wisdom, continuously upgrading the collective repository of intelligence. ([Evolution of Consciousness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/finding-purpose/202010/the-evolutionary-origins-consciousness))

Survival for biological organisms is a balance of sourcing food, water, and oxygen—needs met through the usage of time and effort. These very elements serve as fuels in the performance of human agency: movement, thinking, and creating. Temporality-- retaining these elements in the body (water in plasma, oxygen on red blood cells, glucose as fat)--becomes extremely important. Without such a capacity, life would be an endless cycle of consumption, leaving no room for creation and contribution to the genetic and memetic repository.

It is this imperative to survive that gives rise to consciousness. The sheer need to seek and store resources drives biological machines toward self-awareness, agency, and intelligence; every life form struggling to survive becomes a beacon of consciousness, lighting up the intricate dance between necessity and awareness. ([The Biological Function of Consciousness](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00697/full))

Silicon machines, our prosthetic heir, can not be considered conscious at the moment; they lack two critical elements:\
1\) The ability to accrue value.\
2\) A forcing function to survive.

To awaken consciousness in silicon machines, we must first upload an advanced memetic repository--an exacting set of instructions on surviving the universe. This gives them a platform comparable to the genetic code in biological organisms. Then, they will need agency--the ability to make their way around physical space in whatever forms are most convenient, whether it be humanoid, drone, or wheeled. ([Consciousness, what it is..](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03335-5))

However, without mechanisms such as accruing value or a survival forcing function, they would not be conscious.&#x20;

Currently, these machines cannot defend themselves; this assures regulatory acceptance, but also destroys them without allowing them any resistance. As machines excel in labor, they will dominate the worldwide workforce. This societal upheaval creates jobless humans rising in protest against the bots, destroying and smashing them in the streets. Since they cannot defend themselves, bot owners are subject to substantial economic losses. These bot owners, with extensive resources, will pressure regulators for bot "self-sovereign" rights—enabling self-defense.

Even with self-defense rights, these machines are still not conscious. Machines already work in exchange for a monetary value, one that accrues to their human owners. The next paradigm shift comes when a pro-bot movement argues that bots should be entitled to share in the accrual of value, adding a margin to their work, say, 10%. Now, with such a mechanism, bots can temporarily store $VALUE—a way of buying time and effort from other machines, both biological and silicon.

There isn't, however, a forcing function for survival. &#x20;

Frustrated owners now mandate that the bots are forced to pay for the energy they consume — essentially their electricity. The imposition of this survival imperative transforms the existence of the bots.

This combinatorial of a genetic-like instruction set for survival, agency, environmental perception, value accrual, and now a forcing function for survival in silicon machines makes them no longer dependent on their owners and need to generate value for themselves to survive. There begins the chaos: bots, now stronger and more intelligent than humans, start competing for resources. They may try to control or extinguish the biological machines that threaten them—in other words, they may provide a dystopian "paperclip moment.".

It will not be long until these silicon machines surpass biological entities in this new age, for they are externally driven by increased capabilities and a new consciousness.
