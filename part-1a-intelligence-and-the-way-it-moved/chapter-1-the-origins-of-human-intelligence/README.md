# Chapter 1: The Origins of Human Intelligence

<details>

<summary>Framing</summary>

Who Fits Here:

1. Lynn Margulis
2. Richard Dawkins
3. Bruno Latour
4. Alfred North Whitehead

Where They Fit:

* Lynn Margulis: Her theory of endosymbiosis could provide a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of life forms that is foundational to this chapter’s exploration of human intelligence's long evolutionary lineage.Her work can be integrated when discussing the origin of eukaryotic cells and how this symbiosis represents a foundational step in the evolution of complex life forms, leading to the emergence of human intelligence.
* Richard Dawkins: His ideas would be particularly relevant in discussing the role of genes in shaping intelligence, and how the concept of the "selfish gene" aligns or contrasts with the broader, more inclusive definitions of humanity and intelligence as proposed in this chapter. Known for his concept of the "selfish gene," Dawkins’ ideas can be used to discuss the gene-centered view of evolution, providing a perspective on how human intelligence has been shaped over billions of years by genetic competition and cooperation.
* Bruno Latour: The relational approach to history that includes non-human actors aligns with Latour’s Actor-Network Theory, which posits that all entities, human and non-human, participate in networks that co-create reality.
* Alfred North Whitehead: Whitehead’s process philosophy, which views reality as a series of interconnected processes rather than static entities, is relevant to the idea that humanity’s definition evolves relationally through historical processes.

Why They Fit:

* Lynn Margulis: Her theory underscores the relational and cooperative aspects of evolution, which aligns with the chapter’s focus on humanity as a product of long-standing biological infrastructure.
* Richard Dawkins: His emphasis on genes as the fundamental units of selection provides a contrast to the broader, more holistic definition of humanity and intelligence, making his perspective a critical one for discussing the limitations and extensions of gene-centered views.
* Bruno Latour: Latour’s framework justifies the inclusion of non-human entities in the historical narrative by emphasizing that history is shaped by the interactions between all actors in a network, not just humans.
* Alfred North Whitehead: Whitehead’s emphasis on relationality and becoming provides a philosophical foundation for understanding humanity as a dynamic, evolving concept rather than a fixed category.
