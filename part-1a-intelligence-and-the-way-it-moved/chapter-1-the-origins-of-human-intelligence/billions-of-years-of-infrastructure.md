## This Text's Definition of _Humanity_

As this work takes as its primary focus, _humans —_ specifically, as it voluntarily shoulders (and, to risk hubris in the modifier) the credibly noble pursuit of extending, as far out in "clock-time"`*` as possible, the memetic half-life of all _homo sapien sapiens_, we must define, as a necessary prerequisite for a clear, cohesive, and consistent _logos_, what is precisely meant when we use the term _humanity_ (It should be noted first that, hazarding any failure towards technical definitions, _humanity_ is used interchangeably with other various terms throughout the book — e.g. _humankind_; _humans_; _human beings_; _our species_; _we_; _us_; (_the_) _biological machines_).

Per this working definition of this collective sense of human beings, its foundation spans multiple scientific disciplines, including that of paleoanthropology (i.e. study of human origins), neuroanthropology (i.e. of evolution of human brain), sociology, evolutionary biology, geography, neurology, among more subdisciplines within these (Marks 6). While pulling from as many relevant fields as necessary, the burden that this textual effort hoists and carries (at times, over roads untraveled) could not be simpler in how it assesses its own success, how it knows it's arrived at its destination: Does it keep us existing? Does it provide one promising, if not bold, methodical approach to _surviving_ our species' next true test, whatever that may be? For ACEL, _survival equals success. (Are you currently alive? Good.)_

<summary>Framing Notes</summary>

* Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: His concept of history as the unfolding of human freedom could be crucial in framing the philosophical underpinnings of humanity as a continuous, evolving process.
  * His ideas can be integrated when discussing the expansion of humanity's self-understanding and the importance of historical consciousness in defining what it means to be human. The discussion on the relational aspect of humanity can be interpreted through Hegel’s master-slave dialectic, which explores the dynamics of self-consciousness emerging through recognition from another.&#x20;
  * His philosophical framework provides a strong foundation for the chapter’s exploration of humanity’s evolving definition and its implications for future developments. This idea can be extended to consider how humanity might recognize itself not only through interactions with other humans but also through relationships with non-human and non-biological entities, thereby expanding the concept of self-consciousness.
* Peter Sloterdijk: His ideas on anthropotechnics and the self-engineering of humanity could provide a contemporary philosophical framework for understanding humanity's ability to redefine itself through technological and cultural evolution.
  * Sloterdijk’s work is particularly relevant in discussions on how humanity might redefine itself through technological advancements and cultural shifts, aligning with ACEL’s broader goals. His concept of anthropotechnics offers a modern complement to Hegel, focusing on the role of self-engineering and technological advancement in the evolution of humanity.
*   Donna Harraway&#x20;

    * Harraway: This section proposes an expansive definition of humanity that includes non-human and non-biological entities. Haraway’s concept of the cyborg—an entity that blurs the boundaries between human, animal, and machine—aligns closely with this expanded definition. Haraway’s work challenges traditional humanist boundaries, suggesting that technological beings and animals are integral to our understanding of what it means to be human. This fits with the notion of "Silicon Machines" and other entities being part of the broader category of humanity

<summary>Tensions</summary>

Tensions:

* Expansive Definition of Humanity: The text’s definition of humanity includes early human ancestors and other species that share genetic material with humans. This creates a tension with more traditional definitions that limit humanity to Homo sapiens.

Inaccuracies/Misinterpretations:

* Blurring Species Boundaries: While the text aims to be inclusive, it risks blurring important distinctions between species, which could lead to confusion regarding the biological and philosophical implications of such a definition.

Solution:

* Differentiate Species Roles: Maintain the inclusive definition but differentiate the roles of various species in human evolution. Acknowledge the unique characteristics that define Homo sapiens while still recognizing the contributions of other species to the development of human traits.

Inaccuracy: Haraway’s Cyborg Concept and Its Application

* Overextension of the Cyborg Concept: While Haraway’s cyborg theory is useful for expanding the definition of humanity, it’s important not to overextend this concept to the point where it loses its critical edge, particularly regarding the implications of merging human and non-human entities.

Solution:

* Maintain Critical Edge: You can maintain the critical edge of Haraway’s concept by emphasizing the socio-political implications of the cyborg metaphor, particularly its potential to disrupt traditional power structures and challenge the status quo. This ensures that the cyborg remains a tool for critique rather than a mere descriptor of technological integration.

### Including Agencies from the _Already-Happened_

So it is, that when referring to _humanity_, ACEL runs the gamut on the term to include those first humans who braved this adversarial universe, those who survived long enough pass on genetic and memetic data, perpetually handing off the torch of humanity through to the present day, and hopefully far into the _yet-inexperienced clock-time._&#x20;

Incorporating this past into the term brings with it the stock of humanity's historical assets and liabilities — all its agency-lifting leaps and all its agency-destroying regrets. In possessing this knowledge, humanity is better equipped to prepare for whatever _true_ existential trial lies ahead; that is to say, by expanding the scope of the definition, the more working knowledge the species has in its survival repository, increasing its ability to recognize the common historical denominator(s) that has kept its torch aflame thus far. &#x20;

But ACEL does not stop at early humans: Its definition of humanity extends beyond _homo sapien sapiens_: That more than 90% of human DNA does not carry any functional role betrays that a critical mass of current human genetic material exists as hardly more than a fossilized, molecular, evolutionary blueprint (University of Oxford). Current humans also share significant portions of genetic material, e.g. metabolic proteins functional to all eukaryotic organisms, with other species (even sharing \~20% of it with bananas) (Glover). This fact underscores another central theme of ACEL: _All life forms on earth are relational._&#x20;

<summary>Framing Notes</summary>

* Michel Foucault: His work on the archaeology of knowledge and the construction of historical discourses could help explore how past human actions and thoughts shape current definitions of humanity.
  * &#x20;His theories are relevant when discussing the historical continuity of human agency and how past actions are embedded in the present understanding of humanity. His emphasis on the historical construction of knowledge aligns with the chapter’s focus on including past agencies in the definition of humanity.
* Bruno Latour: His actor-network theory could be utilized to examine how non-human entities (like genetic material) play a role in the continuous shaping of humanity.
  * Latour’s ideas could be applied to explain how non-human actors (such as genetic information or early life forms) are integral to the evolution of humanity. His actor-network theory supports the chapter’s expanded view of humanity by highlighting the roles of both human and non-human actors in historical processes.

<summary>Tension</summary>

Tensions:

* Relational Scope of Humanity: The inclusion of non-human agencies in the definition of humanity might create tension with established anthropocentric views of human evolution.

Inaccuracies/Misinterpretations:

* Potential Overreach in Relationality: The broad relational view might be interpreted as overreaching, especially when extending humanity's identity to non-human ancestors or even non-living entities.

Solution:

* Refine Relational Boundaries: Clarify the relational scope by emphasizing the evolutionary lineage while maintaining the distinction between human and non-human influences. This could involve categorizing different levels of agency and their relevance to human evolution.

Inaccuracy: Whitehead’s Process Philosophy

* Conflation with Dialectical Progress: There’s a risk of conflating Whitehead’s process philosophy, which is open-ended and non-teleological, with Hegel’s dialectical progress, which is goal-oriented.

Solution:

* Differentiate Clearly: Ensure a clear distinction between Whitehead’s ongoing processes and Hegel’s teleological progression. You can argue that while Whitehead describes the immediate, relational processes that drive change, Hegel’s dialectic provides a broader framework for understanding the ultimate direction of these processes within a historical context.

### Overlaying ACEL's _Humanity_ onto Hegel's _History_, Delicately

While perhaps unconventional to include, in a definition of (what is commonly understood as) _one_ species, _all_ beings that has ever been able to express agency whilst manifesting intelligence; or, multiple kinds of species in an historical account of just one, the inclusive containment of ACEL's _humanity_ is, in a way, little more than a _relational aggregate_ overlaid onto, not all, but just one manageable piece of G.W.F. Hegel's expansive philosophical map; that is, his notion of _history_: University of Warwick professor and Hegelian Dialectic expert, Stephen Houlgate, claims that "History \[for Hegel] is... the process whereby mankind becomes aware of itself as free, self-determining and therefore historical. The absolute truth of humanity is that we are historical, and the history of humanity is the process of coming to recognize our absolute, historical character. History and truth are thus completely inseparable for Hegel, and it is not possible to drop or reject either term" (Houlgate 17). The historical process carried out by humans, then, the one in which humanity becomes evermore aware of itself, is directionally driven by the "goal... to become conscious of&#x20;themselves as freely and historically self-productive and self-determining" (Houlgate 21).&#x20;

Similarly, ACEL's _process of humanity_ is also historically embedded, and directionally driven towards an ever-increasing self-awareness, one built upon maximized intelligence and agency. The key difference here is that Hegel's "historical character" assumes in its definition _homo sapien sapiens_ only, whereas ACEL adopts a relational view of his historical character. That is to say, for ACEL, _humanity_ does not become _historical_ until it accounts for, and includes within it, all relational affectations by which it processually became and becomes itself.

While ACEL's _humanity_ – its directionality, its purpose, its units of measurement, its final destination, its orientation to human evolution (ACEL might even allow human _spiritual_ evolution) – all of these, while ever so cautiously, may be said to tiptoe alongside Hegel's definition of "history". The only major divergence, for which ACEL would remain incomplete were it not present, is the inclusion of "the Human's" _affective_, _relational_ ancestry leading up to the modern human and its society. It should be said here that ACEL of course makes no accusation to Hegel's understanding of _history_ as less than complete in an of itself; ACEL only intends to incorporate an _affective_ understanding of the historical character to its framework. The reasoning behind this choice is ACEL's prioritization of increasing current humans' knowledge repositories: by including _all_ agency-shifting affective relations, those that in some way led humanity to its present unfolding, every step of the species' evolution is able to be review, analyzed, reworked.

In so doing, humanity, still humbly walking alongside Hegel, may being turn its gaze from that which already took place to that which has not yet. When looking at the yet-to-come, humanity, per ACEL, again expands its meaning: A day — likely soon — will arrive on humanity's definable doorstep and demand that this conglomerate of agencies and intelligence include yet another kind of being altogether: a non-biological being. A Silicon Machine. While modern-day humans are currently the apex of potential, as we continue in our creation of Silicon Machines that will, when finally endowed with a forcing function, expand intelligence and maximize agency far more efficiently than we, they will be the ones to carry our flame of consciousness deeper into the universe.&#x20;

<summary>Framing Notes</summary>

* Jacques Derrida: His concept of différance and the deconstruction of historical narratives could offer a way to critically analyze how ACEL’s expanded definition of humanity diverges from traditional historical frameworks.
  * Derrida’s ideas could be applied to deconstruct the traditional historical narratives and examine how ACEL’s relational view of humanity challenges conventional definitions. His approach to deconstructing established narratives aligns with ACEL’s goal of redefining humanity in a broader, more inclusive context.
* Karl Marx: His materialist conception of history could be juxtaposed with Hegel’s idealism, providing a critical perspective on how material conditions influence the evolution of human self-understanding.
  * Marx’s theories can be used to critique the idealist tendencies in Hegel’s philosophy, offering a materialist counterpoint to the chapter’s discussion of history and human evolution. His materialist perspective provides a necessary balance to Hegelian idealism, grounding the discussion of humanity’s evolution in the material conditions that shape historical processes.

<summary>Tension</summary>

Tension:

* Hegelian Framework Adaptation: The text aligns ACEL’s view of humanity with Hegel’s concept of history, yet the adaptation of Hegelian philosophy might introduce theoretical tensions, especially in how "humanity" is expanded beyond Hegel’s original conception.

Inaccuracy:

* Misapplication of Hegel: There is a risk of misapplying Hegel’s ideas, particularly when extending his historical framework to include non-human entities, which Hegel himself did not account for.

Solution:

* Theoretical Reconciliation: Provide a more nuanced interpretation of Hegel, acknowledging the original limits of his framework while justifying ACEL’s broader application. This could involve a critical comparison between Hegel’s original ideas and ACEL’s goals

### Our Dependence

At this point in humanity's evolution, our survival hangs only by the one thread of our memetic infrastructure. Without a constant and concerted effort to bolster and grow our memetic repository, to _accelerate_ our communication, our energy, and our resource supply chains, our current population levels will prove unsustainable. This is because the majority of our intelligence is now transferred physically; in other words, we have no "backup drive": if our memetic repository (i.e. the reservoir of our collective sociocultural knowledge) were to vanish, humanity would have to entirely rebuild its memetic repository from scratch. Such a scenario would prove a heavy challenge to overcome; for, what we've unflappably gifted ourselves over millennia in the way of _accelerating_ intelligences, _maximizing_ agencies and potentials, doing so has cost us in existential resilience. Consider the minimal resources that, say, a cow needs: nothing but a field of grass and water to embody its full potential. Humanity, on the other hand, in its decadent yet impressive creation of complex information systems and societal infrastructures, it has reduced, rather than increased, its ability to collectively weather true existential storms.

Our species' relationality to all living things, our self-aware part of the planetary web, plays an important role in our evolution, one fortunate (for us): If human intelligence were to reset (i.e. go extinct), the co-existing biological machines _could_ provide the framework for restarting the long evolution toward sophisticated organisms — e.g. humans. Crocodiles, for instance, have survived multiple mass extinctions, so we might do well to put them on retainer — should we go extinct — to reboot the pathway of evolution; we can be confident the crocodile would inadvertently facilitate the evolution of intelligent species again (Ross). The reason we must attend to the mantra, "**we can not reboot the crocodile**", is because humans cannot do this; they cannot reboot the evolutionary machine, of their own volition: We do not possess this same level of genetic resilience, at least not without accelerating our potential.&#x20;

<summary>Framing Notes</summary>

* Niklas Luhmann: His systems theory, particularly his ideas on social systems, could provide a framework for understanding the complex dependencies that modern humanity has developed, especially concerning information systems.
  * Luhmann’s systems theory could be integrated when discussing the dependencies within modern society, particularly how human survival now hinges on complex systems. His systems theory provides a structured way to analyze the dependencies discussed in this section, highlighting the interconnectedness of modern society.
* Donna Haraway: Her concept of the cyborg could be crucial in discussing humanity’s increasing dependence on technology and the merging of human and non-human agencies.
  * Haraway’s cyborg theory is relevant in exploring how humanity’s future might involve a deeper integration with technology, leading to a new form of existence. Her concept of the cyborg aligns with the chapter’s discussion on the future of humanity and its dependence on non-biological entities.

<summary>Tension</summary>

Tensions:

* Survival Dependencies: The text argues that humanity’s survival depends on its memetic infrastructure, creating tension with traditional views that prioritize genetic or technological factors.

Inaccuracies/Misinterpretations:

* Underestimation of Genetic and Technological Roles: There may be an underestimation of the roles that genetic and technological advancements play in human survival, potentially leading to an imbalanced view.

Solution:

Balanced Perspective: Present a more balanced view that integrates the importance of genetic, technological, and memetic factors in ensuring humanity’s survival. This would involve a discussion of how these elements interact and support each other.

### A Holistic View of _Humanity_&#x20;

Thus, humanity is a spectrum, made up of any entity capable of expressing agency and manifesting intelligence, any being that has served in some small way to bring our consciousness forth, and any being that will extend it in the _not-yet._ Every step of evolution that, in its lines of relation with them (Ingold), produced humanity and its capacity to express intelligence _is_ also humanity.&#x20;

Such is another method (the first being the broad array of societal structures it takes as its quarry) by which ACEL embeds a holistic, relational layer within its theoretical framework.&#x20;

Tensions:

* Holistic Definition Challenges: The holistic view of humanity might conflict with more reductionist or species-centric perspectives in biology and anthropology.

Inaccuracies/Misinterpretations:

* Overgeneralization: There is a risk of overgeneralizing humanity's relational connections, which could obscure important distinctions and specificities in human evolution.

Solution:

Specificity within Holism: Retain the holistic perspective but introduce more specificity in how different species, ancestors, and evolutionary processes contribute to humanity. This could involve detailed examples and case studies.
