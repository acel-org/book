  poised over his swath of vaporous unknowns, we, too, settle into this
  coordinate power, this agency latent in our being human.

## The Mutualism Between _Intelligence_ & _Agency_

This palpable, intensity-dense force — this thrumming potency that stands humans plumb upright and steady-eyed to their catalytic role in the play toward new paradigms — is born not just of a general self-awareness, but of an [awareness _aware_ ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]of the mechanics of its own intelligence, of its own agency – Jean-Paul Sartre says of this, "I must necessarily possess a certain comprehension of freedom," where freedom, for Sartre, is none other (Sartre 439) and of the elevating dynamism between these  elements of _our self_; it is a vision that can not only comprehend, but can focus, can hone in and even manipulate, even _accelerate_ the acquisition of knowledge and the building of agency. This is an awareness that for now is still unique to human beings; and it is just this that places upon the species' shoulders the opportunity — and the responsibility — to secure the continued survival of biological machines.&#x20;

As the successful execution of this duty – that of maximizing intelligence and agency so as to secure a more favorable, i.e. lasting, half-life – is the entire premise of and reason for ACEL, it stands imperative to not only make understood, but to make _deliberate_ the direct, reflexive, causative relationality between _intelligence_ and _agency,_ these two _textures_ _of_ _consciousness_. In so doing, the human _self_ – the gears that turn its consciousness towards and through extension – will, by design, be ever-oriented towards producing maximum output, and thereby deploy its most efficient, most effective potentials toward extending the half-life of t_he_ _Biological Machine._&#x20;

The formula is simple, as it is directly causative: an increase in intelligence begets an increase in agency; an increase in agency begets an increase in intelligence. Thus, not only do these two textures of consciousness operate harmoniously, they exist in a constant feedback loop, a reflexively compounding echo chamber of power. This becomes clear when examining the emergent growth of the non-genetic intelligence repositories of humanity, holistically understood per ACEL. This expansion of the biological machines' collective knowledge has never ceased to be ushered in by an explosion of agency: the RNA replication of itself; the protists' first acts of sexual reproduction; the first standing upright; the first vocalizations grunted – all of these, whether conscious or not, were bold acts of agency that flung wider open these repositories. And, naturally, this acceleration in humanity's intelligence has created new openings for agency. And so on and so forth.&#x20;

Interestingly, when plotting their evolutionary in-step, when tracking their historical foot-stepped data points – variables being _quantity over aggregated time_ – the strides of intelligence and agency presents as a geographical line. That is to say, when zoomed out, there is betrayed out of their dynamism a _fluent, singular directionality_: their power-compounding cadence sometimes ambled, sometimes marched through the quanta of continuities. Theirs is a 4 billion year long stroll –erratic in the short-term, stabile-in-the-long – defined overall by an aggregated growth of one another, whom together are ever-converging with some later _now_. Thus it is seen with aerial view that, over the many once-present millennia, these two pals, upon their first step, have only walked in this very direction – to arrive just here with never as so-deep, so-wide, and so-filled oceans of themselves.

## Hegel's _Historical Process_; ACEL's _Humanity_ Process

Of course, our curious, perhaps suspicious, even appraising gaze upon this sustained and asymptotic orientation of these two in-cahoots structures of consciousness and their by-one-another brimming-over potentia — that self-enchantment locked on thesel — does not claim here what it observes to be original; for this idea is hardly novel: Hegel had been fully aware of this causative interplay between intelligence and agency when writing his 1807 magnum opus, _The Phenomenology of Spirit._ On this, Houlgate sums up cleanly Hegel's position on the matter when he states, "The main source and element of human freedom, for Hegel, is thought" (Houlgate 26). Of course, its unpacking might be a bit messier..

What does Hegel mean by _human freedom,_ if not the state of being in total possession of one's own _capacity to act_, _to think_; the position as sole proprietor — as _agent_ — of one's own existential property? Jean-Paul Sartre in _Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology_ says of this relationship between acting – i.e. agency – and freedom , "the act is the expression of freedom... the fundamental condition of the act is freedom... ;" (Sartre 438). A triangulation is thus at play here: for Sartre, _freedom_ is conditional to and expressed by _action —_ there is no action without freedom; the source of this action-based _freedom_, per Hegel, is _thought_. ACEL agrees with both and considers their amplification of one another, by none other than _agency-driven thought_.&#x20;

In earnest, the compounding model above — that is, the generation of agency by intelligence and the generation of intelligence by agency; the begetting of themselves together — appears to align seamlessly with Hegel à la Houlgate, even down to the grammar: Houlgate's framing in the quote above betrays that, in its relation to agency (via Sartre's unpacking of _freedom_), _thought_ exists as dual-natured: as a _source_ of freedom, i.e. freedom _by-_thought; or, thought begets freedom; and, as an _element_ of freedom, much as Sartre's _act_ is conditional to freedom, i.e. freedom _to_ thought; or, freedom begets thought. Thus it shows that Hegel did indeed perceive this dynamic feedback loop between intelligence and agency; and, of the multitudinous topographies spanning _Phenomenology's_ philosophical map, these two hikers of the human _self_ traverse most profoundly across his treatment of _history._

It is well known that Hegel took an  interest in this dynamism's significance to the _historical process_ of mankind.

&#x20;it appears quite clear to Hegel that, during both humanity's gravest historical intensities as well as its most miraculous advancements, these two friendly  a particular knack for showing a charismatic presence ;

As has been shown, Hegel maintains a pervasive interest in _history_, particularly the history of mankind. More than that, he was interested primarily in&#x20;

In other words, "\[humanity's] profound changes... have been produced, by our becoming more conscious of our freedom and potential for self-determination, and more aware of the way in which that freedom is to be realized and fulfilled in the world" (Houlgate 8)

As so much is ACEL,&#x20;



The fundamental&#x20;advances in history - the emergence of the classical world and the dawn of Christianity,&#x20;for example - are thus the result, for Hegel, of mankind's becoming more aware of itself&#x20;as freely self-determining and thereby actually coming to be more freely self-determining&#x20;in history. 14

&#x20;within, that ACEL might hazard to superimpose a piece of its own framework on one manageable piece of that ACEL has carved out for itself superimpose its historical process Hegel's understanding of _history_, as  — namely, a comparative model of _historical process_ — ACEL's _humanity_ onto Hegel's _history_, and then to which he would retire himself to _homo sapien sapiens_, past, current, and future_._ Houlgate says, _"_\[Hegel] does believe that within the manifold vicissitudes of human history there is an identifiable strand of development from humanity's initial, primitive self-understanding to the much more enlightened perspective of the modern age." For Hegel, each point at which this "strand" threads its next hole through history are those marked by long-tail explosions of self-reflective human intelligence; Houlgate notes, "the most important changes in history have involved shifts in the categories through&#x20;which human beings understand their world... They have been shifts brought about by humanity's growing&#x20;self-awareness" (Houlgate 12).&#x20;







"It is in the modem period, therefore, when human consciousness at last recognizes that it&#x20;is the essential nature of all of humanity to be free, that the demand that thought should&#x20;make it\~elf as explicitly autonomous and self-grounding as it can becomes most urgent" (Houlgate 28).

Each biological machine, through the propagation of genes and through the agented dissemination of their knowledge, contributes to our existential extension of endeavor of advancing and expanding our repositories. &#x20;

## The Role of Parents

Parents play the most pivotal role in this evolutionary journey. By fusing their genetic material, they create offspring with an entirely new set of genetic information. All endowed with evolutionary "entropy," the next generation forms a pool for adaptation and survival. These fusions – genetic variations, are vital to evolutionary progress. (Provine)

Even beyond genetics, a child inherits a vast memetic repository---an archive of condensed cultural wisdom and knowledge-based insights. With every new generation, this repository grows, and thus, any new generation is better-tooled and better-informed than the last.&#x20;

Therefore, the responsibility of the parents is extended, they are more than just genetic sources. The begetter is under obligation to endow their children with at least a basic amount of memetic knowledge, which the children will use to adapt, respond, and navigate through their environment. Their dependence on their parents for memes is provisional, the the offspring will eventually outpace their parents in expanding their repository, progressing and achieving higher levels than their predecessors, in terms of genetic and memetic intelligence -- such a process of progression is vital to the evolutionary enhancement of the human species.&#x20;

In modern society, children who deviate from the norm are often held back and hindered. They are labelled and put on a spectrum (IQ, ADHD, autism) in an effort to control and manage anything that is seen as not usual. This sort of labelling is counter-productive and cruel, kids are diagnosed and given medication, which holds back their development. Studies have shown that children with an ADHD diagnosis have developmental delays of up to three years compared to their peers. (Thomas Armstrong, The Myth of the ADHD Child)

Diagnostic tests, such as the IQ test, provide narrow perspectives on intelligence. Even though they measure certain cognitive abilities, they do not have the capacity to analyze the full range of human intelligence. As a society, instead of confining ourselves to such definitions, we should celebrate intelligence as the ability to survive the universe's adversity --- no matter how; the ultimate objective of life is survival, and we should view intelligence through that lens. Intelligence comes in many forms, it is too versatile to keep within our definitions. For example, a crocodile can survive on a desert island with less effort than a human, who is more intelligent here?

These children, with remarkably extensive intelligence, have high-functioning abilities. Society has a responsibility to magnify and embolden their capacities, instead of subjecting them to narrow definitions. An education system has to be adopted that respects different types of intelligences, contribution to human progress is done collectively by every human on the intelligence spectrum. The diversity in human experiences and the difference in how individuals think should not be seen as a negative, but recognized for the strength that it is. Realizing intellectual diversity and allowing it to flourish allows for a stronger, more resilient society.

* FUSE The parents get to fuse their genetic sequences together, add some entropy to encourage evolutionary discovery and produce a second-generation entity.&#x20;
* GENETIC This entity is injected with a set of genetic instructions that are statistically more likely for them to survive and adapt to universal adversity than their parents. The child is more capable than the parent.&#x20;
* LARGER REPOSITORY Not only that, but the child gets access to an ever larger memetic repository than the parent, that uncovers more of the universe.
* MEMESIS The role of a Parent is to deliver a baseline of memetic knowledge to the Child to accelerate them to a point at which they know enough about their modern environment to safely express agency whilst they explore the universe.
* EXCEED The Parent must recognise that the Child is fully dependent on them for genes and memes, until a point at which they morph into their Peers, and ultimately, exceed them in capability. Children should always be more capable and complex than their parents, because of the progress of Humanity itself.&#x20;
* Parents do not own their Children, they can only campaign them with memes, until they can independently establish their own framework of understanding.&#x20;
* CHILDREN THAT DONT SURPASS A child that does not exceed their Parent in either Genetic and Memetic intelligence, whilst evolutionary a disadvantage, is still critical to humanity itself. All of humanity, up and down the stepladder of progress, is a celebration of agency. At any point on the stepladder of intelligence, the future of humanity can continue to evolve, from a starting point of  any creature.&#x20;
* DIAGNOSES Placing individuals on a spectrum of intelligence (IQ) and labelling them (eg ADHD, Autistic, Asbergers) is not only a disservice to them and a form of control, but also anti-humanity itself. Every biological machine is part of humanity, inside a continuum of Complexity vs Fragility. The more complex a creature is, the more fragile it is, and the more sensitive to adversity.&#x20;
* Labelling a high-functioning child as ADHD (and the rest) is both cruel and a disservice to their capabilities. By putting them in box, they can be “controlled” because those doing the labelling are simply manifesting their own fears. Oppression and Control is always down out of fear.&#x20;
* A high-functioning child has potentially more energy and more capability to express agency whilst exhibiting intelligence. They should be amplified and supported.&#x20;
* MEDICATING Medicating a high-functioning child is even crueller, seeking to decelerate their energy and output because it seems chaotic to the observer. Once again it is a form of control - trying to fit the high-functioning child in a box of average.&#x20;
* Every permutation of humanity should be free to be, to explore the universe and seek to explain it
