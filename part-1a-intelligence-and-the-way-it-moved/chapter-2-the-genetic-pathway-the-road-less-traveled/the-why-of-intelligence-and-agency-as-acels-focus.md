## The Mutualism Between _Intelligence_ & _Agency_: An Overview

This palpable, intensity-dense force — this thrumming potency that stands humans plumb upright and steady-eyed to their catalytic role in the play toward new paradigms — is born not just of a general self-awareness, but of an [awareness _aware_ ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]of the mechanics of its own intelligence, of its own agency, and of the complementary dynamism shared between these two textures of _human consciousness_. Ringing true here is Jean-Paul Sartre's quip, "I must necessarily possess a certain comprehension of freedom," where, as shown below, freedom is but the condition of agency (439). But it is not only the comprehension of the layers composing our consciousness that is within the human's grasp; attendant with this self-appraisal comes the wielding of a focus, one able to hone in, even manipulate, even _accelerate_ the acquisition of knowledge and the building of agency.&#x20;

This is an awareness that for now is still unique to human beings; and it is just this that places upon the species' shoulders the opportunity — and the responsibility — to secure the continued survival of biological machines. For, as the premise of ACEL's entire raison d'être — that of securing for humanity a more favorable, i.e. lasting, half-life — is optimally, perhaps _only_ carried out through just this direct engagement with intelligence and agency. For this reason, it is imperative that this book delineate the reasons for and methods by which one might optimize navigating the direct, reflexive, causative relationality between them.&#x20;

In so doing, the human _self_ — specifically, the gears that turn its consciousness towards, and _through_ the extension of its own species – will, of itself, become singularly oriented toward output maximization; both its intelligence and agency most efficiently deployed, all potentials manifest toward extending the survival of the species. How this is accomplished requires further examination into the play between intelligence and agency.&#x20;

## The Compounding Nature of Coordination&#x20;

The formula is simple, as it is directly causative: an increase in intelligence begets an increase in agency; an increase in agency begets an increase in intelligence. Not only do these two textures of consciousness operate harmoniously, they exist in a consistent feedback loop, a reflexively compounding echo chamber of power. This becomes clear when examining the emergent growth of humanity: the RNA replication of itself; the protists' first acts of sexual reproduction; the first standing upright; the first vocalizations grunted — all of these, whether conscious or not, were bold acts of agency that flung wide open the doors to larger intelligence repositories. In turn, these deepened reservoirs of knowledge walked humanity, or a primitive iteration of it, up to yet another explosion of agency. And so on and so forth.&#x20;

Interestingly, when plotting this evolutionary in-step, when tracking their historical foot-stepped data points – variables _quantity over aggregated time_ – the strides of intelligence and agency present a geographical line. That is to say, when zoomed out, there is betrayed out of their concordant play a _fluent, singular directionality_: their power-compounding cadence sometimes ambled, sometimes marched through a 4-billion-year quanta of continuities. Theirs is a long stroll — erratic in the short-term, stabile-in-the-long — defined overall by an aggregated growth of one another, whom together are ever-converging with some later _now_. Thus, it is seen with long aerial view that, over the many once-present millennia, these two pals, from their first step, have only walked in this very direction — to arrive just here with never as so-deep, so-wide, and so-filled oceans of themselves.

## This Relationship's Theoretical Precedent&#x20;

Of course, upon this sustained, directional, asymptotic orientation of these two in-cahoots structures of consciousness, particularly their one-by-another brimming-over potential, our curious, perhaps suspicious-for-obviousness, even capitalist-appraising gaze, our locked and literal _self_-enchantment can not claim here what it observes to be original, for this idea is hardly novel: Hegel had been fully aware of this causative interplay between intelligence and agency when writing his 1807 magnum opus, _The Phenomenology of Spirit._ On this, Houlgate sums up cleanly Hegel's position on the matter when he states, "The main source and element of human freedom, for Hegel, is thought" (Houlgate 26). It is easy enough to understand "thought" here as _intelligence_; but what does Hegel mean by _human freedom,_ if not the state of being in total possession of one's own _capacity to act_, _to think_; the being sole proprietor — the _agent_ — of one's own existential property?&#x20;

To corroborate initial readings of Hegel's meaning, we might consider Jean-Paul Sartre's notion of _freedom_ in _On Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology_. Within, Sartre says of _freedom_ — specifically, of the relationship between freedom and "the act_",_ i.e. agency, "the act is the expression of freedom... the fundamental condition of the act is freedom" (Sartre 438). For Sartre, then, _freedom_ is conditional _to_ and expressed _by_ and _through_ action. In short, there is no agency without freedom, because agency _is_ freedom: the _freedom to act_.&#x20;

This evinces a formulaic causative connection between these concepts for Sartre and Hegel: For Sartre, the fundamental condition of action (i.e. agency) is _freedom_; Hegel claims that the source of this freedom is _thought_ (i.e. intelligence). Taken together, Sartre and Hegel reveal that _thought is the source for the condition of action_. Said another way: _intelligence is the source of the condition of agency_.&#x20;

But there is more to this relationship than just unidirectional causality: In fact, when analyzing Hegel (à la Houlgate) through the lens of Sartre's notion of _freedom_, it becomes apparent that Hegel, too, implicitly suggests there exists an intercausative relationship between intelligence and agency. Per Houlgate's quote above, Hegel understood thought/intelligence to be _dual-natured_ in its relationship to freedom/agency: as both the latter's primary "source" _and_ its primary "element". It has already been shown above how thought/intelligence is _source_ _to_ and _causative of_ freedom/agency (i.e. freedom-_by-_thought). It is this second piece — that of thought/intelligence as _elemental_ to freedom/agency — that betrays a simultaneous and inverse causation for Hegel. Using the syllogistic formula, if, for Sartre, "the act is the expression of freedom;" and the main element of freedom for  Hegel is _thought_; then it can be stated that, "the act is the expression of the primary element of thought." To say this another way, agency expresses, or manifests, or evokes — _causes —_ intelligence.&#x20;

Thus it is, in the intercausative mutualism between these two structures of consciousness — particularly in the _accelerant_ _leveraging_ of this relationship —that ACEL sees a most optimal ground for its survivalist methodology: that by which it will most effectively ensure the survival and extension of humanity. But, despite their positive relationship, what affords _intelligence_ and _agency_ such allowance of faith, that they together are that which gives humanity its best hope of surviving and extending the existence of humanity?&#x20;

## Hegel's _Historical Process_; ACEL's _Humanity_ Process

The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, can be found in the philosophy of Hegel, particularly in the way in which he views _history_, and the authority of meaning that his _historical process_ endows mankind. Simply put, _history_, for Hegel, is a _human process_ defined by a time-aggregated increase in humanity's self-awareness; Houlgate says, "History is thus the process whereby human beings come to new levels of awareness of their freedom, of their productive, active nature, and thereby produce new forms of social and political life. The human activity of self-production is, therefore, at the same time the process of self-discovery and self-revelation — a fusion of making oneself and finding oneself, of acting and of coming to know, which is perhaps best expressed in English by the word 'self-realization'" (18).&#x20;

Houlgate's framing could not have been much more attuned to the present purposes. While it is of note how he lays out Hegel's history as a process defined by a time-aggregated growth of humanity's self-awareness — one that progresses towards a "self-realization", of most interest are the modes by which Hegel's _historical process_ advances. Of these, there are two. The first is "the human activity of self-production", which is none other than the activation of _agency_; the other is "the process of self-discovery and self-revelation", or, the growth of _intelligence_ (18). But that is not all: Houlgate notes that this _activation of agency_ "is, therefore, at the same time" the _growth of intelligence_. They are of one substance; and he states this is, "a fusion... of _acting_ and of _coming to_ _know_" (italics added for emphasis) (18). Thus, for Hegel, humanity evolves itself towards self-realization through the ceaseless compounding play between its intelligence and its agency. As self-realization connotes a _surviving_ to that end, so it is for ACEL.&#x20;

Still more can be gleaned from how, and _where_, intelligence and agency manifest within Hegel's historical framework. Houlgate notes that "the profound changes \[of humanity] that interest Hegel have been produced... by our becoming more conscious of our freedom and potential for self-determination, and more aware of the way in which that freedom is to be realized and fulfilled in the world" (8). He continues, "The fundamental&#x20;advances in history... are thus the result, for Hegel, of mankind's becoming more aware of itself&#x20;as freely self-determining and thereby actually coming to be more freely self-determining&#x20;in history" (14). In other words, attendant to all of the "profound changes" and "fundamental advancements" that humanity has experienced over time, both our species' gravest historical intensities as well as its most miraculous advancements, are these two faculties of human consciousness — are _intelligence_ and _agency_. At any major point in the history of humanity, these two pals are front and center.&#x20;

Here we must account for one substantive, but not deal-breaking, difference between Hegel's model and that of ACEL, which can be&#x20;

Of this, Houlgate says, _"_\[Hegel] does believe that within the manifold vicissitudes of human history there is an identifiable strand of development from humanity's initial, primitive self-understanding to the much more enlightened perspective of the modern age" (12). For Hegel, each hold at which this "strand" threads itself into the historical process are those marked by long-tail explosions of self-reflective human intelligence and agency: "Hegel argues the most important changes in history have involved shifts in the categories through&#x20;which human beings understand their world... They have been shifts brought about by humanity's growing&#x20;self-awareness... In Hegel's view, therefore, certain shifts in cultural perspective have resulted not merely from a change in human self-understanding, but rather from a _deepening_ of human self-understanding. Such shifts constitute, for him, a progressive development towards the truth. They represent humanity's increasing awareness of the essential nature of our own character, activity and thought — a growing self-awareness that brings with it a more adequate understanding of the world around us"" (12, 13).&#x20;

Recalling that

Houlgate says, "The goal of historical activity, for Hegel, is... for human beings to become conscious of themselves as freely and historically self-productive and self-determining... and for them to build their world in accordance with that recognition" (21). More, "Becoming aware of the true character of human existence... means learning that what we are is the process of producing and determining ourselves... it means learning that this process of self-production is itself the process of coming to _understand_ more dearly that we are self-producing beings... we learn that it is above all through changes in our self-understanding that we actually make ourselves into and so _become_ something new: we produce ourselves precisely through developing a fuller understanding that we do so" (21).

This is because ACEL shares with Hegel a&#x20;

Within this frame, then, ACEL might hazard to overlay a piece of its own framework on one manageable piece of Hegel's philosophical map  — namely, a comparative model of _historical process_ — and as such,  ACEL's _humanity_ onto Hegel's _history_,&#x20;

He believes that the emergence of humanity's sense of its own freedom of critical reflection marks a real development or progress in human self-awareness, 15

"It is in the modern period, therefore, when human consciousness at last recognizes that it&#x20;is the essential nature of all of humanity to be free, that the demand that thought should&#x20;make it\~elf as explicitly autonomous and self-grounding as it can becomes most urgent" (Houlgate 28).

* Hegel thus dearly does not believe that&#x20;  we are all marching gloriously to full self-awareness in all that we do. Yet he does believe&#x20;  that within the manifold vicissitudes of human history there is an identifiable strand of&#x20;  development from humanity's initial, primitive self-understanding to the much more&#x20;  enlightened perspective of the modern age. 12
* "History is indeed essentially the process whereby mankind becomes aware of itself as free, self-determining and therefore historical. The absolute truth of humanity is that we are historical, and the history of humanity is the process of coming to recognize our absolute, historical character. History and truth are thus completely inseparable for Hegel, and it is not possible to drop or reject either term. 17
* this process of growing self-awareness has an endpoint: namely when we become fully conscious of the fact that all human beings have the potential to be free, self-determining agents 8
  * does not mean for him simply becoming conscious of a given, fixed reality or gaining a more accurate picture of what we were like at the beginning of history21

&#x20;It is simply that each intelligence and agency have evoked its other, have perpetuated and compounded upon one another since life, even pre-life, began.  Their perpetual co-maximization, their co-acceleration can be seen and evidenced through aggregated time. Perhaps this is why, of the multitudinous topographies spanning _Phenomenology's_ philosophical map, these two hikers of the human _self_ traverse most visibly across Hegel's treatment of _history._

Each biological machine, through the propagation of genes and through the agented dissemination of their knowledge, contributes to our existential extension of endeavor of advancing and expanding our repositories. &#x20;
