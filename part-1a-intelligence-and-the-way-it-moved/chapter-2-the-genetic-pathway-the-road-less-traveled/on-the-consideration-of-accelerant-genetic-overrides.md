# On the Consideration of Accelerant Genetic Overrides

Throughout our history, humanity has dreamt of immortality. Considering the rate at which technology is evolving, we might be reaching advancements that could, potentially, "switch off" genetic aging. If we were to ever achieve that, there are deep issues regarding our futures that have to be considered.

A world where people no longer age -- a concept once confined to the limits of science fiction and imagination -- is currently being researched by scientists, and not just authors. However, if we were to do this, what might the implications be? One of the main concerns is that since people would be living forever, they, therefore would not have to replace themselves-- thus the birth rate would be in decline and ultimately, the population would decrease -- there would be a halt to natural procreation.

This trend partly exists in the current times and can be seen in statistics. Modern societies give prestige to longevity and health ahead of reproduction only. Global birth rates are decreasing, and immense resources are spent in health care and maintenance of people -- persistence is prioritized over all. According to statistics provided by the United Nations, world fertility has been halved since 1950, and the trend continues downhill. Is this truly the future we want to preserve -- existence over evolution and propagation?

Accelerationism gives a different perspective. The philosophy is, humanity should use technology as a means of increasing intelligence and efficiency -- genetic reproduction should not only be preserved, but encouraged. We should advocate for procreation while we still can, ensuring the continuation of our species and the diversity of our genetic pool, allowing it to be ever growing and ever evolving.&#x20;

In simple terms, natural selection is the evolutionary process through which the "good" is taken to survive, and the "bad" is discarded. The advancement of medicine, however, interferes with this homeostasis -- premature deaths, proposed by evolution, are prevented. Pre-birth artificial selection could be a solution to this, screenings can be done to embryos for potential genetic problems, allowing us to have healthier generations without relying on post-birth natural selection. Such a process must be carried out with the highest sensitivity, making sure to prevent ethical dilemmas and an embittered society. The key to this is to view it as a positive-- a charitable and needful process, that prevents suffering and allows us to maximize our potential.

Prebirth artificial selection, through genetic screening and editing at the embryonic stage, not only allows us to find genes responsible for specific disorders, but even "correct" them if needed. This system will help in drastically reducing cases of heredity-acquired diseases in the upcoming generations. New and improved techniques, such as the CRISPR-Cas9, allow for exact modifications. This opens up many opportunities of improving human life, potentially wiping cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, and certain cancers off the surface of Earth, and taking them away from our genetic pool.

Ethically, this is a tricky landscape to traverse. Problems arise such as "designer babies" where genetic enhancements can be made for non-medical traits such as extra intelligence or any feature related to appearances. One must tread carefully and sail through this terrain responsibly, as the line between therapeutic intervention and genetic enhancement is thin. There will be those who argue that this is a drive towards genetic monotony and potentially shuts down the possibility of new evolutionary blooms. However, in reality, the severe limits to natural selection have been imposed upon us by specific medical interventions in the modern world. We have tacitly adopted a "freeze in genetic instructions" while relying increasingly on memetic pathways, such as these interventions, and neglecting the genetic pathway.

Notably, genetic modifications are slow and painful --requiring death, therefore, it is high time to go all in towards advancing memetic intelligence, and retiring genetic upgrades completely. This reinforces the line of reasoning for the concept of "Space brains"--that is, the unification of human consciousness with advanced technology. The ultimate offering of memetic intelligence is to fuse the biological brains with the silicon, allowing us to achieve a much higher capacity of knowledge transfer by interfacing with silicon-based technology directly.&#x20;

It would be a giant step in human evolution, where cognitive development and enhancement of knowledge take priority over genetic evolution.&#x20;
