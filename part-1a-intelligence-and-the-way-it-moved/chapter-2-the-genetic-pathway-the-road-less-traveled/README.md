# Chapter 2: The Genetic Pathway: The Road Less Traveled

<details>

<summary>Framing Notes </summary>



* James Watson and Francis Crick: Their discovery of the DNA double helix is central to the understanding of genetic inheritance and the biological transmission of information.
* Barbara McClintock: Her work on transposable elements, or "jumping genes," could provide insights into the dynamic nature of genetic information and its capacity for adaptation.

Where They Fit:

* James Watson and Francis Crick: Their discovery is foundational when discussing the structure and function of DNA, setting the stage for modern genetics.
* Barbara McClintock: Her research on genetic mobility adds depth to the discussion of how genetic information is not static but can change and adapt over time, influencing evolution.

Why They Fit:

* James Watson and Francis Crick: Their work is essential for any discussion of DNA and its role in heredity, providing the fundamental basis for understanding genetic pathways.
* Barbara McClintock: Her insights into genetic flexibility and adaptation are crucial for exploring how genetic information can evolve and respond to environmental pressures.
