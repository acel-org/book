# School of ACCEL

As humans now learn and evolve predominantly through memetic channels, we must leverage this pathway and accelerate our youth's access to our species' memetic repository. Doing so will maintain pace with the ever-growing complexity of modern environments, humankind's ability to navigate them. For example, a child in a remote Indonesian fishing village might reach the necessary baseline knowledge quicker and start contributing to their community at a younger age compared to a child in a bustling metropolis like Singapore, New York, or Sydney, who must assimilate a much larger volume of information before making significant contributions.

This raises the question: How efficiently can we impart this foundational knowledge to our youth? Is the [<mark style="color:purple;">traditional model</mark> ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]-- twelve years of schooling followed by three to four years of specialized higher education -- the most effective approach? What if there were a school designed solely to accelerate the transfer of this vast memetic repository, aiming to equip young people with the necessary knowledge to expedite their contribution to humanityâ€™s acceleration?\


This is an intriguing concept: efficiently hitting[ <mark style="color:purple;">upper band of memetic transfer</mark>](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]. Imagine a school that leverages contemporary technology to pursue this limit. ACCEL's conceptual approach would present as such: The school leverages AI-driven teaching methods in a high-stimulation environment 1:1 teacher:student ratio. Each day, students cycle through various subjects in 20 minute educational sessions, followed by 10 minutes of testing. The rapid rotation helps to maintain engagement and focus, while immediate testing serves to reinforce learning and continuously assess the student's comprehension rate, allowing for highly personalized content delivery. This 'immediate testing' model is corroborated by current [<mark style="color:purple;">pedagogical best practices research</mark>](#user-content-fn-3)[^3].

The student in the School of ACCEL then reaches young adulthood. In our current social structure, our [<mark style="color:purple;">young adults often aren't granted full agency until they are 18 to 21 years old</mark>](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]. Instead of this being a low-output period, ACCEL's proposed system uses this time to maximize the upload of memetic content, covering a broad spectrum of disciplines including art, music, science, engineering, and more. Upon reaching the designated age, graduates would possess a foundational level of knowledge enabling them to begin their own paths of acceleration.

Because educational delivery is driven by AI instructors with the latest AI models, the School of ACCEL and its low-staffing requirements[ <mark style="color:purple;">scales easily, needing only a single physical site equipped with suitable audio-visual technology</mark>](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]. A large auditorium would suffice, one filled with individual booths where students receive tailored instruction, swapping booths every half hour to allow for social interaction --  this, too, will only build students' personal memetic repositories. The building would connect to a global network -- e.g. Starlink -- for consistent internet access.

The school's key performance indicators, or KPI's, would focus on graduating students between 18 to 21 years old with the deepest possible memetic understanding. The longer a student engages with the system, the more extensive their memetic comprehension should become.

The overarching goal of this educational initiative is to bestow the next generation with a profound understanding of the universe, as well as to inspire them to impact humanity positively and perpetuate the ethos of acceleration. This school aims to not just educate but to ignite a transformative movement that shifts how we approach learning and human potential. We must start the School of ACCEL as soon as a suitable jurisdiction is found.&#x20;
