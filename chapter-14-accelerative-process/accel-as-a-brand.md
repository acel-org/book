# ACCEL as a Brand

The Accelerationist movement, still in its youth, is missing some sort of clear and convincing narrative. Intellectual thought leaders in the field often somewhat struggle to describe the essence of the movement in a way that would impress the general population at large. There needs to be more effective means of communication and engagement, as Noam Chomsky articulated, "The general population doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't know that it doesn't know."

Such an accelerated movement has to underpin a vigorous, easily recognizable brand---one that will do justice to its values, ideals, and vision--- extracting from the complexities of the whole movement an easily accessible and transparent narrative. It must radiate action, intelligence, progress, creativity, ingenuity, and optimism---  representing the best aspects of humanity. A well-crafted brand can shift perceptions and create widespread interest and enthusiasm, as Elon Musk said, "Brand is just a perception, and perception will match reality over time."

This brand should celebrate human achievements, and our insatiable drive for exploring possibilities and solving problems. It could inspire pride and aspiration by speaking about achievements and potential as a collective -- one humanity. Similarly to the Red Bull brand, it needs to be marketed via active, action-oriented events and media.&#x20;

ACCEL will be fronted as an adventure-wear brand. It will first break headlines at events and campaigns, telling its stories of exploring and celebrating technology. ACCEL won't just be 'merch'; it will symbolize a movement. In a similar fashion to how Red Bull grew to mean more than energy drinks, through diversification of their activities, ACCEL will bloom too, as a marketing juggernaut to crow about the Accelerationist vision.

The journey will begin with merchandising, then leap into media and action-oriented products. This can extend to areas like energy drinks and even an F1 team to show the pinnacle of technological advancements and engineering in sports.&#x20;

In contrast to brands that exist solely to maximize profit, ACCEL's mission will be to market and progress the Accelerationist movement as sustainable as possible.  Each margin or profit will be reinvested into the brand, working towards accelerating human progress. Such an approach will ensure that it keeps true to its core values and vision.

The ownership structure of ACCEL shall be such that it allows public participation. Any person who believes in the brand's vision and would like to be a part of this movement will have the liberty to buy the product or equity of the company. Such a model assures broad support and creates a community-driven approach toward growth and innovation.&#x20;
