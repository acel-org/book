# Accelerate or Die

As a _general_ movement, accelerationism thrives most of all because of its active community. Within this overarching ideological band, a number of diverse interpretations, insights, and inputs have been proferred, extending out -- like rhizomes -- a number of community subsets.&#x20;

ACCEL, as a subset of broad accelerationism, is no different: It empowers and reflects a particular community's thoughts and experiences, and so this book is _alive_, in a sense. Indeed, this text will only stay true to itself if the following requisite is carried out: Annually, this book is to be returned to and revised -- this adherence to perpetually renovating content ensures the text _lives_, and _accelerates its own ideas_, along with the movement itself.

With such a collaborative approach, in coordination with the accepting that the _content herein presents just one of many accelerative approaches to human evolution_, this thought experiment may be understood as an outgrowth of the _e/acc_ movement, and it intends to carve a new path for accelerationism -- one that champions, above all, human intelligence.

In an effort to obtain maximum traction on this particular road, the book should be publicized and distributed far and wide. The pricing strategy should ensure that the revenue would cover production and popularization costs, ensuring that every sale furthers the dissemination of the book. Basically, every sale from the book should be reinvested back into itself to maximize reach and impac[<mark style="color:purple;">t; as Benjamin Franklin once said, "An investment in knowledge pays the best interest."</mark> ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

The revenue gained from selling the book would be reinvested in its publishing and distribution, furthering its progression. The accelerated writing and publicizing of the book enables it to have as many iterations based on community feedback as possible. Such a dynamic allows the work to stay up-to-date and be endlessly improved by its readership-- allowing it to be the highest authority on accelerationism.&#x20;

This book aims to provide the movement with a _living record_, capturing divergent perspectives, effectively self-market and reinvest in its future to be patented as a legacy text that defines and furthers accelerationism. This living document will charge an exponentially speeding journey to the future.&#x20;
