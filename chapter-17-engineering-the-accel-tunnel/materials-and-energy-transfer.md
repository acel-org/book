# Materials and Energy Transfer

Material selection is critical to the construction and function of the ACCEL Tunnel. On payload acceleration, its walls will be subjected to extreme mechanical stresses and electromagnetic forces.

State-of-the-art composite materials and alloys of high strength are more than adequate to handle this portfolio, ensuring resistance to any kind of durability and wear. In addition, the tunnel will be lined with super-capacitors that store and execute energy discharge efficiently to create the requisite electromagnetic fields needed for the acceleration of the payload.&#x20;

One of the most important material science concerns will be the ability of the tunnel to bear thermal and mechanical stresses developed by the passage of the payload at high speed. This will be effectively managed by innovative materials such as carbon composites and reinforced ceramics, which exhibit exceptional thermal conductivity and mechanical strength, making them ideal for high-stress applications like the ACCEL Tunnel"

Again, the ACCEL tunnel demands exact timing and coordination of their electromagnetic fields. There are two major types or categories of EMF fields in the tunnel area, namely, the pulsing EMF and self-centering EMF fields.&#x20;

The self-centering EMF field will maintain the payload structure throughout at a centrally aligned position within the tunnel area, thereby preventing its payload from reaching and pounding against the interior walls of the tunnel, damaging them. The pulsing EMF field, produced by the super-capacitors, pushes the payload down the length of the tunnel. These super-capacitors are discharged for moments at a time, thereby generating powerful electromagnetic pulses that accelerate the payload to a velocity of choice. The nose and tail of the payload feature magnets to amplify the effects of the EMF fields and ensure an efficient energy transfer.

This tunnel uses a laser tracking system to keep both the timing and effectiveness of the EMF fields. The device would view the progress of the payload and would – at every discharge – re-calibrate the timing for the super-capacitors, ensuring optimum acceleration was happening in real-time.
