# Automation and Safety

Most of the construction in the ACCEL Tunnel is automated to ensure precision and efficiency. Autonomous drilling machines do the bulk of work in drilling. These machines drill through mountain rock as they construct tunnel walls.

Equipped with advanced sensors, artificial intelligence engages in navigating and changing drilling parameters in real time for accuracy and most minor human error. The application of autonomous drilling technology greatly improves the accuracy and safety of tunnel engineering projects.

The ACCEL Tunnel concerns itself with safety, more so during a biological payload launch. To give added security to these payloads during high-speed accelerations, several vital features come into play to guarantee the well-being of the payload. The self-centering field of the EMF prevents contact between the payload and the tunnel walls, reducing damage and providing a smooth ride. Moreover, precise acceleration curve control minimizes the physical stress on the payload, and this process becomes survivable at an acceleration of about 30g.

The vacuum environment inside the tunnel provides zero air resistance to the payload, reducing thermal stress. Needless to say, this tunnel is also fitted with rapid decompression systems and emergency stop mechanisms that will ensure safe deceleration and retrieval in case of any emergency.

The construction and operation of the tunnel are also integrated with strict safety measures and monitoring systems. The data received from sensors in the entire tunnel is analyzed in real-time for the detection of any anomalies and triggering the automated response in case of any mishappening.

The ACCEL Tunnel is a fusion of advanced engineering, innovative materials, and leading technology. This includes high-pressure water-jet boring, self-operated drilling machines, sophisticated designs for EMF fields, and therefore assures that the tunnel not only supports but significantly exceeds the requirements needed for efficient and safe payload launches.&#x20;

Advanced materials and real-time monitoring systems enhance durability and operational efficiency, thereby opening a new way for space transportation. In this respect, these technologies have made the ACCEL Tunnel set new standards within the space launch infrastructure by showing that engineering ingenuity has overcome any challenge to the high-speed acceleration of biological payloads and, in the process, made it safe.&#x20;
