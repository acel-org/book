# Design and Operation

The Kinetic Launch System, proposed with the ACCEL Tunnel, may prove to be an incredibly advanced technological wonder that could forever change payload delivery to the upper atmosphere and beyond. This basic tenet of this system involves the imparting of maximum kinetic energy to the payload via a smooth acceleration curve to achieve speeds and altitudes never seen before.&#x20;

This would represent a very efficient and potentially reusable version of traditional rocket launches as it overcomes most of the limitations of chemical propulsion by using electromagnetic forces, ensuring a clean and controlled method of achieving high velocities.

Essentially the KLS system is a coil gun device that accelerates a payload down the length of its barrel through electromagnetic induction through a series of coils. The coil gun works inside a specially constructed vacuum tunnel, which is an integral part to avoid air drag and for efficient energy transmission. A standard coil gun fires a series of electromagnetic coils quickly, producing a magnetic field to help drive the payload. The vacuum environment of the tunnel is necessary for minimizing air resistance so that the payload does not dissipate energy by drag. This 80-100 km vacuum tunnel ensures almost no frictional force on the payload, ensuring maximum acceleration efficiency.

The vacuum tunnel is not only a technological but also a structural marvel. Various engineering challenges arise in the maintenance of the vacuum over such a long distance, for which robust materials and precise ways of construction are essential. Its design features several layers made from reinforced materials to bear the vast forces that come into play during the acceleration phase.

The timing and synchronization of electromagnetic coils working at the correct times ensure that a coil gun works.

The coils are powered on in rapid succession as the payload travels through the tunnel, then providing a constant and strong magnetic field. That field pushes the payload at forces of acceleration of around 30g, speeding up to Mach 20 within 10-15 seconds. This kind of rapid acceleration—a velocity increment comparable to the launch speed of an ICBM—is carefully controlled so that the payload, whether biological or mechanical in nature, actually manages to survive such intense forces. Noting that carefully shielded biological material can actually survive 30G. Any lower G-forces would simply require a longer and higher tunnel.

The design and operation of the KLS are both a synthesis of state-of-the-art electromagnetic technology and pioneering vacuum tunnel construction. This system represents only a glimpse of what will be the base for a revolution in payload delivery and sets the stage for future space transportation.
