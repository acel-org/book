# Technical Specifications

The principal aim of any kinetic launch system would be to propel payloads up to the highest possible altitude while trying to minimize launched energy. It thus accelerates the payload at about 30G force while attaining speeds at a minimum of Mach 20. Such acceleration levels, although very extreme, have been shown to allow survival of carefully shielded biological machines and most robust payloads.

The acceleration profile is carefully designed so that the increase from zero to maximum velocity should be smooth, thereby avoiding any shock or structural damage to the payload. At the end, this system will reach top velocity in 10 seconds, a timespan that maximizes both energy efficiency and mechanical stress. It could reach a speed of Mach 20 only when the electromagnetic forces are precisely controlled within the 80-kilometer vacuum tunnel. Advanced sensors and control systems along each segment of the tunnel continuously monitor and regulate the magnetic field so that optimum acceleration is maintained, both for the structural integrity of the tunnel and that of the payload.

The most important thing in design and operation is the location of the ACCEL Tunnel. Such ideal locations will incorporate sites with minimal seismic action, stable geology, and accessible infrastructure in construction and maintenance. Besides that, the site should be at a high altitude to minimize atmospheric drag and maximize launch system efficiency.

Setting up the tunnel in a remote area serves to give minimal effects resulting from human interference and maximize safety considerations. The site to be selected for the tunnel has to guarantee reasonable levels of access to sources of power since the coil gun will consume vast amounts of electrical energy in its functions.

Atmospheric conditions influence the performance of the launch system. As much as the vacuum tunnel clears air resistance in the initial acceleration phase, the payload exits into the atmosphere. The exit point from the tunnel must, hence, be high enough to reduce atmospheric drag and thermal stress on the payload. That would ensure that with minimal energy loss, it can finish the rise to the required altitude efficiently.

The technical specifications of the KLS are carefully designed for optimizations regarding acceleration and altitude; this will help in efficiency, safety, and reliability of the system.
