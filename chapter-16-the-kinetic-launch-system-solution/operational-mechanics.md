# Operational Mechanics

Building an 80 kilometer vacuum tunnel is a massive engineering challenge by itself. First, the tunnel must be sealed perfectly; secondly, air needs to be removed by solid vacuum pumps for low pressure. The materials to be used must be able to withstand external forces -- atmospheric pressure--  as well as internal forces, caused by the electromagnetic acceleration.

A hybrid mechanical-plasma shield at the tunnel's exit point ensures the tunnel remains in a vacuum even when operating. The mechanical shield seals the tunnel 24-7, opening just prior to the payload ejecting, with the plasma shield sealing the tunnel whilst it is open. The plasma shield is made by ionizing a gas at the exit from this tunnel, yielding a gradual payload transition from a vacuum to the atmosphere.&#x20;

One of the prime advantages that KLS holds over most conventional rocket launches is cost efficiency. It has high capital cost, but low operating costs. Since it uses electromagnetic acceleration, it does not need any expensive fuels or complex systems to get propulsion, which are potent cost factors.&#x20;

The overall energy requirements of the KLS, however, will be huge in order to accelerate the payload to Mach 20. Improving renewable energy sources and energy storage systems will offset these demands. Solar panels, wind turbines, and advanced batteries will also help in reducing the environmental impact and operational costs by providing sustainable power.
