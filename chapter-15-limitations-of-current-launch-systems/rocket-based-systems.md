# Rocket-Based Systems

It is well known that the traditional backbone of space exploration is rocket-based systems. There is no doubt that these systems have accelerated us to our current positions -- <mark style="color:purple;">t</mark>[<mark style="color:purple;">hey've allowed us lunar landings, satellite orbiting, and solar system exploration. And yet, as a species we've arrived to the realization that rocket-based systems hold implicit and severe limitations</mark>](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] -- these generally concern energy inefficiency, payload constraints, and environmental and operational constraints.

It's when when we look at their energy use that we recognize rocket-based launch systems carry heavy inefficiencies. Most rockets use chemical propulsion, whereby, typically, liquid fuel (hydrogen, methane or kerosene) combines with liquid oxygen and combusts to provide the required thrust. In doing so, a large amount of energy contained in the fuel is wasted on heat instead of being converted into kinetic energy. According to aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin, "Chemical rockets are only about 2-3% efficient in converting the energy of the propellants into kinetic energy of the rocket". This low efficiency ensures that vast quantities of fuel have to be carried, which, in turn, increases the mass and, consequently, the cost of the [<mark style="background-color:blue;">rocket</mark>](#user-content-fn-2)[^2].

Another huge constraint resulting from [<mark style="color:purple;">inefficient chemical propulsion is a severe limitation in the payload.</mark>](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation states that the propellant mass grows exponentially with the desired velocity. The point is, since the velocities required to attain an orbit or move around planets are pretty significant, a considerable amount of fuel must be loaded onto rockets, leaving little space for payloads. As a result, only a tiny fraction of masses launched by current rocket systems is ever delivered as usable payload. For example, NASA's SLS can take only about 27 metric tons to the Moon, while the rocket itself weighs more than 2,500 metric [<mark style="background-color:blue;">tons</mark>](#user-content-fn-4)[^4].

Even with these low-percentage outputs, launching rockets has high-percentage environmental impacts. With any given rocket propellant, there is introduced into the atmosphere many byproducts of combustion. For instance, solid rocket boosters, like the type used on the Space Shuttle, emit chlorine gas into the atmosphere which may lead to the sustained ozone depletion. Additionally, liquid rockets release vast amounts of carbon dioxide and a considerable volume of water vapor; the former contributes to greenhouse gases, while the latter affects upper atmosphere processes. [<mark style="color:purple;">According to a study by the Aerospace Corporation, rocket launches are heavily responsible for significant ozone depletion.</mark>](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]

Also limiting to the flexibility and frequency of rocket launches are operational constraints. Rockets are complex: Many preparation and safety measures are required, bringing a high cost and longer lead times. [<mark style="color:purple;">Every launch comes with its own set of logistical challenges, from launching sites, to the assembly and fueling of missiles, to coordinating air and sea traffic for a safe corridor</mark>](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]. [<mark style="color:purple;">All of these factors contribute to the extravagant cost of a rocket launch</mark>](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]. John Logsdon, a space policy expert, said "The economics of space launch have always been challenging, with high costs and limited launch opportunities."

Weather, too, adds another layer of uncertainty to the equation, and <mark style="color:purple;">can postpone or even scrub a launch altogether</mark>. Hazardous conditions like high winds, lightning, and other bad weather could cancel a launch at any moment and cause --very costly-- delays for the rocket and its payload.&#x20;

Though such rocket-based systems have been revolutionary, the significant limitations to their energy inefficiency, payload constraints, and environmental and operational impacts set them back. That squarely challenges these difficulties if space exploration is to have any future. As[ <mark style="color:purple;">Elon Musk aptly said</mark>](#user-content-fn-8)[^8], "If we're going to be a multi-planet species, we need to reduce the cost of space travel." Such innovations must occur in the propulsion technologies, reusable rockets, and alternative launch methods; these will allow us to transcend those limitations within our capabilities in space.
