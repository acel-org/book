# Economic and Social Impact

### &#x20;Goals, Strategy, Benefits, Obstacles

The accelerant-forward economic and social potencies that lie latent within the ACCEL Tunnel project [<mark style="color:purple;">contain half-lives lasting centuries</mark>](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]; but, in order for the tunnel to distribute these enduring, expansive memetic impacts, project leads must navigate some potentially tricky political and socioeconomic hurdles. Were our current global ethos _accelerant_, and were our global economy that of _pure_ capitalism, the ACCEL Tunnel [<mark style="color:purple;">would likely have already been built by now</mark>](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]. However, we know this is not the case; instead, we find our mission very likely threatened by active _decelerant_ efforts. And yet our existential need to evolve our intelligence demands that we build the Tunnel, as it is, in very concrete terms, integral to our survival. For this reason, we must take deliberate steps to plan and strategize every piece involved in its construction; we must execute our goal in a cost-effective and timely manner; and we must claim victory over all obstacles, probable or not. Our success in these matters will open the door to the next phase of human evolution.&#x20;

### Market Outgrowth from ACCEL Tunnel

As it pioneers revolutionary space transport for commercial and scientific payloads, the ACCEL Tunnel will, in ways that [<mark style="color:purple;">perhaps only the internet has done thus far</mark>](#user-content-fn-3)[^3],  [<mark style="color:purple;">actuate burgeoning multiplicities of fresh pathways in the global market</mark>](#user-content-fn-4)[^4], as well as establish emergent, prosperous socioeconomic assemblages across the globe. In other words, by generating multiplicitous, rhizomatic outgrowths of entirely new market sectors -- both ones we do know of and ones we don't -- the ACCEL Tunnel will catalyze an era of global prosperity.

If this is challenging claim to accept, it is like due to the fact that the space launch market is still so nascent and as-of-yet unscaled. However, it[ <mark style="color:purple;">is foreseen to grow significantly in the years to come, with a rise in demand for effective and affordable launch systems.</mark>](#user-content-fn-5)[^5] More, the promise of the Tunnel's global economic impact does not stop at direct revenue generated from launches: It also includes the thousands of [<mark style="color:purple;">jobs the sector will create</mark>](#user-content-fn-6)[^6], all of the technological and theoretical breakthroughs it will effect, the fresh partnerships and peace-building collaborations within international diplomacy spheres, as well as the[ <mark style="color:purple;">cross-pollination of heretofore mutually-exclusive industries</mark>](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]<mark style="color:purple;">.</mark>&#x20;

While all of these potentialities lie latent within the concept of the ACCEL Tunnel -- potencies that would organically extend the Tunnel's memetic half-life out by centuries -- even with all of this promise, _still_ there exists only a very narrow route to its successful construction.

### Funding Approach & Contractual Overview

We must bootstrap all ACCEL Tunnel funding with zero reliance on _decelerant_ types of financial support â€“ e.g. government lobbying. By doing so, <mark style="color:purple;">we will avoid unnecessary, inertia-breeding bureaucratic inefficiencies</mark>.&#x20;

Instead, we first initiate the research & development phase as it was laid out in the previous section, eventually completing, to asymptotic-level perfection, the buildout of an operational, scaled-down [<mark style="color:purple;">prototype -- e.g. a small tunnel</mark>](#user-content-fn-8)[^8]. Then, after having already given our ACCEL Tunnel pitch to the national economic ambassadors from each of the five Himalayan-Mountain-containing nations -- e.g. Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, Pakistan -- which included year-based market projections of their nation's GPD inflows that account  for Tunnel construction, we invite invite them to our tunnel. Here, we will demonstrate and confirm for them our proof-of-concept. To this point, all was paid for out-of-pocket.&#x20;

We will strike buildout deals with some number of these five nations. From them, we will seek and acquire:&#x20;

**a)** Appropriate licensing permits for constructing Tunnel on negotiated 25k ft mountain in Himalayas;&#x20;

**b)** National public endorsements and media campaigns;&#x20;

**c)** Ongoing funding with fixed, agreed upon amount

In exchange for their investment and partnership, ACCEL Tunnel company will provide:&#x20;

**a)** regular time-based update log of construction progress (time-intervals accommodated to request)

**b)** contracted percentage of profits/shares/dividends from the ACCEL Tunnel company

**c)** a stimulated economy, longterm stability, increased national agency, and international relevance

These contracts between the ACCEL Tunnel company and Himalayan nation(s) will be detailed, thorough, transparent, and fixed. Depending on bandwidth, the Tunnel project leader will agree to contracts with **all five nations**, creating a connective circuit between all three.&#x20;

### Decelerant Roadblocks&#x20;

While it should not be difficult to garner support from any number of these five nations -- as they will be hard pressed to decline ACCEL Tunnel's permit application once they see the economic projections of their country's GDP -- there do exist other obstacles that threaten the successful completion and full operation of the ACCEL Tunnel. To see these hazards clearly, we briefly turn our gaze back toward our earlier theorization on _decelerant_ Woke Ideology, a widespread sociological infection currently plaguing a critical mass of the developed world's governments and societies. While the accelerant-forward Himalayan governments involved in project construction will recognize -- in the spirit of pure, free-market capitalism -- the flood-like revenue stream the tunnels will pour into their nation's GDP, the Decel-run nations will inevitably and aggressively try to put up roadblocks to kill this project. They will do this by [<mark style="color:purple;">uniting together under the facade of</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark>_<mark style="color:purple;">planetary reverence</mark>_](#user-content-fn-9)[^9]: Ever predictable, they will claim that the Himalayas are a sacred earthly treasure and ought never be excavated nor commercially exploited, even if they were humankind's only and final resort for continued survival and evolution -- which, in fact, they are. We must be prepared for this decelerant agenda and beat them in this arena. The optimal route by which to resolve this potential public image issue, however, is not through aggressive silencing, media manipulation, or brute [<mark style="color:yellow;">force</mark>](#user-content-fn-10)[^10], but rather through active listening and authentic compassion.&#x20;

### Approach to Public Relations

This environmentalist opposition to the ACCEL Tunnel project will cite precedents for ecological concerns and disrupted or displaced communities. The Tunnel project leadership proactively acknowledges and prioritizes addressing these concerns through[ <mark style="color:purple;">frequent, open communication-style town hall meetings</mark>](#user-content-fn-11)[^11], as well as rigorous environmental impact assessments, which are published frequently, transparently, honestly, and consistently. [<mark style="color:purple;">Public-facing compassion</mark> ](#user-content-fn-12)[^12]is essential for an optimal and expeditious buildout and even longterm success of the Tunnel. Tunnel leadership puts genuine efforts to make changes where possible (without sacrificing efficiency progress towards goal), exercises patience with the disgruntled, and strives to hear all.&#x20;

This opposition can be further attenuated by educating the general public on the various scientific and environmental safeguards built into and carried out during the construction. Public support for the project will be better bolstered by frequent framing of positives, such as the lowering of access cost to space and the contributions being made to scientific advancements; acknowledging shortcomings and goals for improvement will also go far.&#x20;

Through sincere community engagement, elaborating on the benefits earned and the safety measures undertaken, the project can muster support from both the public and the local government. The project can even extend its public perception by deploying multiple PR managers to explain the broader societal benefits, including job creation and new technology -- these could all be powerful points to garner support.&#x20;

Additionally, it can [<mark style="color:purple;">create opportunities for the educational sector</mark> ](#user-content-fn-13)[^13]-- e.g. internships, scholarships, collaborative research opportunities. This clearly aligns the project with any nation's priorities and makes it more attractive to both a) the general public, by demonstratively showing that the organization is actively invested in and cares about public welfare, and b) workforce development. Rather than putting efforts to silence a disgruntled public, success will be best found by visibly showing concerted effort into creating its opposite: a positive public image. In this way, one subverts any Decel brand tarnishing -- we kill them with (genuine) kindness.&#x20;

It should be noted here that, because this project buildout will take place entirely 20,000 feet to 26,000 feet on top of a Himalayan mountain in some South Asian countries, the [<mark style="color:purple;">social and political reach of the decelerant West will actually be significantly limited.</mark> ](#user-content-fn-14)[^14]Jurisdictional constraints will also severely restrict their agency  in attempting to block this project. Through whatever means they attempt to stop the Tunnel, it will not be stopped.&#x20;
