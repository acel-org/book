# Accelerating Beyond Accelerationism

## Diverging from Accelerationism's Past &#x20;

The attempt to lay down in writing a reflective observation of Accelerationism presents any observer with an immediate challenge, as the motley denominations and ideas contained within the term are placeable under a number of umbrellas within and beyond the human sciences. That is, the term has been a challenge to define. In a positive framing, it might be considered a philosophy, a thought system, an inspired movement. And yet, while only having only been neologized in 2010 (Noys), Accelerationism, in its short life, has been designated by media outlets as a "cult", a "fringe philosophy", a "far-left group", a "far-right group" -- even certain pockets of extremists who inaccurately claim this namesake have warranted the label of "terrorist organization" (MacColl; Beckett; Gardiner; Hughes, Miller-Idriss; Parker). Soon, there will be reason to lift this heavily shadowed brushstroke up and off before the end of the page.&#x20;

First, a note about Accelerationism, generally: What fundamentally connects all of these disparate groups under one umbrella, the connective piece between so many various and highly differentiated belief systems who choose to claim this particular namesake as their orienting structure, is that, at its most basic level, Accelerationism maintains a vehement and normative focus on "maximizing output". In other words, its system purports an action-oriented ethos toward the production of results, whatever those results may be.&#x20;

To be sure, each group claiming the Accelerationism namesake tends to hold as proprietary their own _brand_ of their output -- so while their "product" differs, the results-based framework is more or less cookie-cutter: such is why Accelerationism finds its application in so many various settings. Regardless of the benign outputs of some Accelerationist groups, the action-oriented ethos itself has often brought the general movement into conflict with presiding hegemonic structures. And with the more violent, uninformed fringe sects having wreaked havoc in its name, so it is that Accelerationism, in _all_ of its iterations, has been pinned as "insurgent", "violent", and "divisive" (Parker).&#x20;

This text is a recounting of observations of one brand of Accelerationism, one that may very well offer hope of a brighter future for Accelerationism by unlocking its latent potentials as yet untapped. This instantiation of Accelerationism is called ACEL.&#x20;

## ACEL

As stated, within these pages is a focused, textual observation of a fresh outgrowth of Accelerationism known as ACEL. This thought system, and its attendant action, takes two radically different approaches to Accelerationist ideas: First, its "outputs" are two-fold and human-oriented: ACEL aims to maximize human intelligence and human agency, bar none -- and these are purposed to secure and advance the continued evolution of our species. Second, rather than directly attack power structures as many other sects do, ACEL _takes advantage_ of society's available process systems -- e.g. capitalism, technology, biology -- and aims to _speed them up_ in ways that optimize all of humanity's growth and evolution. It does _not_ intend to topple them or tear them down. Instead, it adheres to the ethos of free-market capitalism according to Ludwig von Mises, meaning it champions a system where good ideas flourish organically, and bad ideas die organically -- it, as a thought system, allows room for the free market of ideas to maximize their potential, all for the goodness of human intelligence and the security of continued evolution.&#x20;

At first glance, ACEL's ethos is admittedly reminiscent of the following lines from Walt Whitman's poem "Song of Myself", who writes,

{% code fullWidth="false" %}
```
Urge and urge and urge,
Always the procreant urge of the world.

Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex,
Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life. (24)
```
{% endcode %}

In the way that it places _intelligence_ and _agency_ -- two equals championed within the human experience -- as its "outputs", ACEL diverges from the aggressive ethos of other sects of Accelerationism, as well as from the violent stains on the namesake's history. Really, according to the observation that is laid forth herein, the observer may conclude that the clearest and most precise packaging for the ACEL ideology is to place it within the framework of _normative ethics_; for, at its core, it appears to be a quasi`*`-_act utilitarian_ philosophical movement (Eggleston) â€“ one that prioritizes streamlining the advancement of human _intelligence_ and the maximizing of human _agency,_ both of which remain teleologically-oriented to ensuring a safe and secure pathway for our species' evolution, inclusively speaking. It is in this way that humans may realize the full potential of their inherent agency. &#x20;

`(*quasi - as it carries Accelerationist conventions of morality, e.g. maximizing output is attendant to morality)`
