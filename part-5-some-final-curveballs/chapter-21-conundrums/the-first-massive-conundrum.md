# The First Massive Conundrum

Accelerationism, as an established thought system, assumes its deepest root in the idea that machina have agency and can -- and _should_ -- express intelligence. The entire belief structure, and all theoretical propositions and pragmatic applications that extend from it, rest on this fundamental principle of agency.&#x20;

But _what if_, instead, we are all, in computer science-speak, deterministic state machines (i.e. DSFs), and we in fact have no free agency at all? This opposing consideration presents a potential critical flaw in Accelerationism, as its possibility renders faulty its philosophical foundation. We must address this "massive conundrum": face head on the plausibility that our existential mystery and depth amounts to no more than the [<mark style="color:purple;">computational advantage of a vending machine</mark>](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

But what _is_ a deterministic state machine, exactly, and what about it makes it such an apt analogy for a human _sans_ agency? [<mark style="color:purple;">Automata theory posits that DSF</mark>](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] is an abstract computational model, a machine that takes a discrete set of inputs, percolates it over a fixed set of instructions to create a known state "transition", and from that produces a discrete set of outputs. These machines carry in their design _no_ ability to alter _either_ the input set _nor_ the instructions set -- this it [<mark style="color:purple;">the template of non-agency</mark>](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]. &#x20;

Of interest here is whether or not humans wield the ability to alter either or both of these first two processes. In the negative, <mark style="color:purple;">i</mark>[<mark style="color:purple;">f it can be proved that the inputs to humans are discrete, and our sets of instructions are also discrete, then it logically follows that our outputs are also discrete.</mark>](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] As shown above, if this is so, then it concludes that humans wields zero agency, for they have no ability to change the inputs nor the state-transition instructions. Here, then, would be the theoretical crack in the foundation of Accelerationism.

If we are nothing more than deterministic state machines, nothing more than[ <mark style="color:purple;">inputs and outputs computing the universe</mark>](#user-content-fn-5)[^5], then our [<mark style="color:purple;">ontological teleology</mark>](#user-content-fn-6)[^6] dissolves into existence inseparable and indistinguishable from the universal vibrations, undifferentiated by any unique purpose from that which "_computes us_ _to compute_". This would, in no uncertain terms, pin humanity in direct contrast to its longstanding and vain self-identity as [_<mark style="color:purple;">intelligent life</mark>_<mark style="color:purple;">;</mark>](#user-content-fn-7)[^7] for, without agency, there is no intelligence. Instead, we biological machines are at any point the aggregation of all previous state transitions, an additive series of computational updates.&#x20;

Indeed, the universe, in providing us machines our external inputs, has preordained our every move and made us merely the internalized machinations of itself, our _other. O_ur instructions are therefore informed by both our previous state transitions, as well as those of the universe. And yet, this _other_ seems no more ostensibly or hierarchically intelligent than us; for, while carrying extremely high entropy, the entropy expansion itself seems to never deviate from nor alter the rules of the universe. Therefore, it, too, is nothing more than aggregation of previous state transitions of its phenomenological self.&#x20;
