# The Second Massive Conundrum

While the first conundrum might be enough to crack the foundations of Accelerationist thought, there exists yet another, a second conundrum that could break it beyond repair. This second tension attends to the implications of dimensionality, and more specifically, our phenomenological inability to access realms beyond our dimensional baseline. Should reality exist on a infinitely-extending spectrum of dimensions, then we stand no further than the starting line, which proves to be a precarious place from which to proclaim universal truths.&#x20;

While humans have through time discovered and applied new ways to enhance our sensory cognition, at baseline, we still observe the universe using the very same bandwidth the early humans did 10,000 years ago -- sensors that we now know detect only a narrow slice of material reality. For instance, it has been long documented in definitive scientific studies that the spectrum of visible light our eyes can discern rests roughly between <mark style="color:purple;">400nm to 700nm of light</mark> -- a humbling fact when considering this range makes up onl[y <mark style="color:purple;">0.0035% of the electromagnetic spectrum.</mark>](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] Said differently, it is a _scientific fact_ that humans see _thirty-five one-millionths_ of light-reality (_at least,_ for this might one day be proven to be even less).&#x20;

While we've done well with our gamut of sensory-amplifying technologies, it seems that the nature of this phenomenological beast may forever leave us short of illustrating a definitively full picture of reality. To do this would require entirely new approaches to sensory advancements. For, even with [<mark style="color:purple;">specialized, advanced hearing equipment</mark>](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] and the knowing that the range of possible sound spans far beyond the upper and lower bands of the human hearing range at <mark style="color:purple;">100hz - 20khz</mark>, there is virtually nothing to be done to conquer all sound. More, while we can leverage the precision and versatility offered by silicon sensors to perceive not only further distances but even _alternate_ scales of perception altogether (e.g. magnetic fields), none of silicon's wide ranging functionalities change the simple fact that, as of right now, our range of universal observation sits stuck between <mark style="color:purple;">1mm in front of us to distance of the radius of the speed of light</mark> -- in other words, from the tips of our noses to the edge of the observable universe. Ironically, while we deploy these tools to explore deeper and farther to better understand our experientially unknown domains, we at once find ourselves with not only _less_ answers, but a plethora of new questions and new unknowns -- and this is the case in every direction we look.&#x20;

Indeed, there appears to exist in each manifestation of phenomenological materiality a strong pattern not unlike the <mark style="color:purple;">Mandelbrot set</mark>: From simple sets of governing rules emerge entirely chaotic, inertia-free expressions unbound by lower or upper limits -- in other words, not the subatomic nor the cosmic applications of physics contain any conditional edge for these expressions. Intersectionalities arise between these emergences, each of which we might understand as one _slice_ of the whole universe -- we, the human species[<mark style="color:purple;">, exist</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark>_<mark style="color:purple;">somewhere</mark>_ <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">along the band of</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark>_<mark style="color:purple;">one</mark>_ <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">of these very slices</mark>](#user-content-fn-3)[^3].&#x20;

These shards of the universal whole may occupy anywhere along the asymptotic upper and asymptotic lower scales. Should they bump into, pass by, bisect, or even coexist in proximity with one another, more emergences are formed; however, even with all these pieces of the universe in disjointed motion, the observable probability of our witnessing firsthand any other reality is infinitesimal, as having precise matching conditions of _band zone location_ and _proximal nearness_, are asymptotic to zero. Still, while we may never _see_ these other realities, in no way discredits the entirely possibility, if not probability, that _our_ observed slice of the universe is at any given moment co-existing with other slices, just on far-detached scales. Should we one day find the ability to shift scales up or down, we may find an entirely different reality of the universe; of course, this capability, while exciting, would barely increase any chance of [<mark style="color:purple;">actually witnessing another slice of the universe</mark>](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] <mark style="color:purple;">-</mark> [  <mark style="color:purple;">one unfamiliar, distinct, n</mark>](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]<mark style="color:purple;">ovel.</mark>

What does all of this highly abstracted hypothesizing of "slices" of the universe slipping past one another and creating new emergences in their interactions tell us? In short, it means we know next to nothing about an infinitesimal fraction of reality. For, at one end, there exists theoretically unbounded, infinite dimensionality; at the other, the key-hole sized phenomenological aperture through which we humans are existentially resigned to observe but a piece of the universal reality. This is further corroborated by the posture in [<mark style="color:purple;">quantum physics that our perceptions</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark>_<mark style="color:purple;">disguise</mark>_ <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">reality in the cloak of physical materiality</mark>](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]: you can touch it, it feels heavy, it exists in space -- and yet, there is in fact nothing there. For, a quantum inspection of the material existence reveals itself as nothing more than empty space and vibrations of fields. Matter thus does not exist in the nature we think it does; it is just the forces of the fields from the vibrations of the universe on an endless analogue continuum.&#x20;

Needless to say, the conundrum set forth in this chapter carries with it the very high likelihood that the claims proferred by not only Accelerationism, but any thought system, arise out of phenomenological observations that are _severely_ limited in scale due to their subjectivity. This is hardly a novel revelation for our collective memetic self-consciousness, as even in the Tittha Sutta scripture written in 500BCE, the Buddha tells the parable, "The Blind Men and the Elephant," in which he expounds on the perils of claiming objective truths based on subjective experiences and dismissing others' equally (in)valid claims as false ([Titta Sutta](https://buddhismnow.com/2018/02/16/tittha-sutta-buddhist-parable-of-the-blind-men-and-the-elephant/)).&#x20;

Thus, it emerges as a _potentiality_ that humans might not only exist as deterministic state machines carrying out the internalizations of the universe itself, but also that there might be no limit -- in either upper or lower size scales -- to the end of these state machines. And so it is, to posit a truth as universal and withstanding outside the bounds of phenomenological experience, all the while standing within one's own experience, is to commit philosophical suicide.&#x20;
