# Financial Evolution in Phases

### Global Financial System Currently

The parasitic inefficiencies within our global financial system are staggering in number. To list a few:&#x20;

1. Exorbitant amounts of needless currencies dilute spending power.
2. Governments perform underhanded seignorage and steal from citizens.
3. Taxation is inconsistent and consumes extreme bandwidth from taxed entities.
4. Public agencies are corrupt and don't disclose spending/donations.&#x20;
5. Private citizens have lost access to private transactions; are surveilled.&#x20;

As our flow of value will change with the onset of biological-silicon machine coexistence, our global financial system -- and the inefficiencies sucking the life out of it -- will also inevitably evolve. This process is outlined below:

### Phase 1

The global financial system becomes tokenized and adopts a single asset. U.S. treasuries are composed of stablecoins.&#x20;

#### Overview

In this first phase, global finance fully adopts the use of blockchain (e.g. Ethereum Layer2) and uses a stablecoin as its settlement assets. All citizens, business owners, financial entities and government agencies have a wallet on-chain.&#x20;

The L2 has two transaction types:

1\) Public

2\) Private

All transactions between, to and from public agencies are public and open to audit. All transactions between citizens are private.&#x20;

#### Taxation

Rather than taxation be a post-transaction process, it is performed directly on the transaction itself. The transaction tax is registered between any transaction between non-like and private entities (excluding like and public entities). The transaction tax scales between 0-20% and is set by that nation's Treasury. This encourages certain industries to be stimulated or depressed as needed; and that these movements are publicly visible, there is no corruption.&#x20;

Tax returns are thus no longer necessary, nor are tax accountants or a government tax department, as all tax payments occur in full with instant finality. Refund-handling mechanisms are the only post-transaction necessity to unwind tax payments.&#x20;

Tax is paid only on non-like entity payments (i.e. a private citizen registers multiple wallets, but no tax is imposed on intra-wallet payments). Zero-knowledge proofs enable this mechanism without doxxing the private citizen or their balances.&#x20;

A nation's treasury would collect tax-based revenue at an agreed-upon level (e.g. 10% of GDP). As an example, should Australia collect 10% of their $2T GDP, they would collect \~$200B a year in tax-based revenue. This is more than enough to handle government spending obligations once useless agency spending is eliminated.&#x20;

#### Rollout

Each nation's treasury performs a one-time mint-and-merge into tokenized US Treasuries. This burns the supply of the nation's native asset for a single swap into $USD. This action is conducted using an L2 with on-chain launch liquidity.&#x20;

### Phase 2

$USD is not the final asset of choice. It is Bitcoin. However, until Bitcoin reaches further adoption and maturity, it can not be used as a daily currency (unless these  nations were to accept the volatility of USD-BTC and make the switch). The volatility on the USD-BTC paid decreases over time; at some point, a threshold is met and the switch is made.&#x20;

Following this, the Ethereum L2 switches from tokenized US Treasuries to tokenized BTC (i.e. become a Bitcoin L2). This is completed via a public purchase of BTC and then all balances swapped out on-chain for a pro-rata share of the BTC acquired.&#x20;

The infrastructure is the same: Since no seignorage is needed, the transaction tax of the BTC is sufficient to fund said nation's Treasury.&#x20;

#### Potential Go-To-Market Strategy

Research island nations with poor currency controls and weak native currencies. Campaign their treasuries to adopt tokenization. Some options below:

* Fiji, $FJD, 1.5bn, $0.69bn
* Papua New Guinea, $PGK, 3.7bn, $1.04bn
* Samoa, $WST, 0.7bn, $0.26bn
* Solomon Islands, $SBD, 1.1bn, $0.13bn
* Tonga, $TOP, 0.5bn, $0.21bn
* Vanuatu, $VUV, 40bn, $0.34bn

The USD Stablecoin that bootstraps the entire country is accepted as a loan (private or public). The loan can be repaid by increased monetary velocity paying fees to the lender, or increased efficiency of the country (since it will operate hyper-effectively and attract overseas investment).&#x20;
