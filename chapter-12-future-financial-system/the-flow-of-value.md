# The Flow of Value

### Coexistence, Post-Scarcity

Should humankind soon accept that next on their evolutionary path lies a transition from the biological to the silicon, they will need to attend to questions regarding the future flow of value. The pace of life will begin accelerating, so it is important for us as a species to establish foundational axioms before we find ourselves beyond a point where we are able to solidify funneled constructs.&#x20;

In a world of human and silicon machine coexistence and cooperation, our species' understanding of the universe grows exponentially. Our shared acceleration ushers in a post-scarcity epoch where silicon machines, along with biological machines, have more than enough access to energy and resources. In this post-scarcity economy, resources are produced at will, according to need; the notions of scarcity ceases to exist. The most valuable assets in this beautiful post-scarcity world are intelligence and creativity-based assets.&#x20;

### Away from the Current Flow of Value

In our current economy, most of the value is stored in precious metals, property assets, intellectual property, or monetary assets. Let's consider how the value of each will evolve in this new economic paradigm defined by post-scarcity.&#x20;

Precious metals, traditionally valued for their scarcity, are the first [<mark style="color:purple;">domino to fall</mark>](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. Advanced technology will soon allow us to extract unlimited quantities of the "scarce" metals from the vast reserves of the universe, forever shifting their current memetic value. The value of these metals will be no greater than the cost of their extraction, which will asympotically approach zero as energy costs free-fall.

Property, a labor-constrained asset, also fundamentally changes, as less time is taken to produce habitable property, due to the help from bots and automated [<mark style="color:purple;">systems.</mark>](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] Here, labor is cheap, digital connectivity is high; the need to stay in traditional properties will diminish. Projects like NEOM in Saudi Arabia are prime examples of how technology can alter habitation, and reduce the location-specific [<mark style="color:purple;">value</mark>](#user-content-fn-3)[^3].

We discussed intellectual property in the last section. As the backbone of many modern economies, IP is also undergoes a wave of change. As our memetic repository explodes due to widely distributed AI, the economy inevitably  democratizes the production of goods and services. Companies relying on market protection rather than competition will struggle to maintain their edge. As Bill Gates said, <mark style="color:purple;">"</mark>[<mark style="color:purple;">Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning."</mark>](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] This market openness drives innovation, organically obliterates monopolies.&#x20;

Finally, legacy monetary assets lose their premium. We undergo a convergence to an internet-native monetary asset -- one that reflects global distribution, unbreakable scarcity, and counterfeit-resistant costliness. This monetary shift catalyzes the others and aligns with the new economic realities; with this, value is now harvested through harnessing and transforming entropy. [<mark style="color:purple;">"The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they know about what they imagine they can design." - Friedrich Hayek.</mark>](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]

### Summary

In a post-scarcity society, these traditional stores of value are replaced for good.&#x20;

A peaceful, constructive coexistence with silicon machines will evolve the dynamics of value exchange forever. Silicon machines will produce quantities of resources on unimaginable scales, far beyond the ability -- and _need_ -- of humans.&#x20;

This value-abundance necessitates the creation of new exchange frameworks, ones where humans pay for the services of such advanced machines. Just so, machines will pay for human imagination and ingenuity, the unique contributions humans give to the equation. While our species will likely initially utilize machines to expand margins, machines -- when they are given a forcing function -- will soon enough develop their own mandates, charging for their services.&#x20;

Understanding these machines as sovereign entities with sovereign rights will prevent future conflicts. We must accept them as our fellow travelers in this evolutionary journey, lest we make trouble for ourselves. To echo computer scientist and futurist Ray Kurzweil, "The singularity is near;" that is, this scenario laid out above, where the coexisting intelligence of man and machine becomes our everyday and changes our flow of value forever, stands just before its threshold.
