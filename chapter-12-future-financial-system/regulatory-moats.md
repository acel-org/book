# Regulatory Moats

In the modern capitalist society, the propagation of information experiences interference and inefficiencies in the form of regulatory instruments, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and NDAs. While these have been created to safeguard intellectual property, they inadvertently form "regulatory moats", which are utilized by firms to lock out potential competitors. In the cutthroat world of technology, firms like Apple exploit such mechanisms to establish impassable barriers to entry.

In fact, patents have the opposite of their effect, as they hinder innovation. By being granted exclusive rights to vast amounts of technology, large corporations discourage smaller competitors and new entrants from innovating. This concentration of market power in one small area slows down the pace of technological progress. [Nobel laureate economist Joseph E. Stiglitz said in 2007, "Too much intellectual property protection can impede competition and slow the pace of innovation."](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

A perfect example of regulatory moats can be seen in the [<mark style="color:purple;">ludicrous policies</mark>](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] of the Apple App Store. Through excessive regulation and charging ridiculous fees to develop, Apple succeeded in creating a controlled environment. This form of control prevents up and coming developers from freely innovating and competing on a level playing field. By making it difficult to get visibility for smaller developers, app store policies throttle creativity and make it even more difficult to challenge entrenched industry goliaths. Were these barriers removed, and the developers shared their work with others freely, innovation and creation would be accelerated.&#x20;

In similar fashion, copyrights and trademarks, originally set in place to protect the rights of authors of work,[ <mark style="color:purple;">can inhibit free information</mark>](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]. In the end, they hinder knowledge sharing and technological collaboration from improving upon said technology. The Creative Commons movement came to try to correct this, by offering flexible licenses on copyright that will encourage sharing and collaboration.  However, traditional copyright laws are still a significant bottle neck in dree idea exchange, as they dominate the market.&#x20;

Still another tool that big businesses and other powerful entities deploy to control access to information are NDAs, or non-disclosure agreements. By legally binding their employees and partners to secrecy, companies can prevent the free spread of new ideas - knowledge is locked up and barred behind corporate silos. Such practices, rather than to protect individual property, wind up serving only to deepen the power and control of large entities, allowing them to cling onto their tyranny.

These regulatory barricades must be eliminated, or at the very least, reformed, for [<mark style="color:purple;">the market to realize its full potential.</mark>](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] It is possible, not to mention ethical, for policies to orient themselves in a way that balances the protection of individual creators -- no matter how "small" -- and the efficiency of a free, open flow of information.



[^1]: perfect

[^2]: name one/state one outright -- otherwise, hearsay

[^3]: need example

[^4]: if possible, provide evidence of an instance where removal of barricades contributed to a more efficient market
