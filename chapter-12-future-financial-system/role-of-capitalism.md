# Role of Capitalism

Capitalism in an actual free market works very similar to genetic evolution: Natural selection deems that everything except the fittest survive and pass on their traits; just so, capitalism kills off all but the most viable of ideas and innovations. It's an aspect that is indispensable to our memetic repository's development - it is, in effect, the reward function for good ideas.&#x20;

In genetic evolution, the reward function is absolute: life or death. When it comes to ideas, that mechanism for reward is the allocation of value; bad ideas die because they can not attract investment or consumer interest. In contrast, the ideas that can attract value prove their worth by commanding resources and attention. [<mark style="color:purple;">Friedrich Hayek</mark> ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]said, "The economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place" (<mark style="color:purple;">citation</mark>). In an actual free market, that adaptation would happen organically, with the valuable ideas being rewarded, the less than valuable fading into nonexistence.&#x20;

Any commodity or product that commands a premium in a free market immediately and automatically validates the value inherent in it. That premium reflects directly its utility, innovation, and desirability. This "market validation", the  immediacy of its attribution, ensures that only valuable contributions are recognized and duly rewarded; in this type of isolated system, the best ideas flourish.&#x20;

If our market were truly a free market, then it should emulate the above description: free and distributed, where good ideas rise to join and further the collective memetic repository. However, Decels, elites with interests in power, work to distort the natural flow of value and innovation: They put <mark style="color:purple;">regulatory barriers in place and corrupt markets.</mark> Decels deploy troublesome legislation that disrupt free market flow, only allowing the types of economies that benefit big businesses and their own bank accounts, crushing any worthwhile competition. This _caricature of capitalism_ inevitably ends up creating <mark style="color:purple;">monopolies, where a majority of the market value is siphoned into the hands of a few lobbyists</mark>. These systems and regulations pushed by the Decels act as a hindrance to new ideas and innovation.

Due to this centralized control and monopolistic tendencies, Decels lead societies towards economic inefficiencies and inequities amongst the population. Governments tend to react to this by introducing taxation policies, seeking to redistribute the wealth from the creators of margins to its consumers. This, however, may introduce further distortions into the dynamics of the markets, possibly reducing the incentives for innovation and efficiency.&#x20;

To fulfill the possibilities of capitalism, we must find ways to unfetter our economy from these inefficient roadblocks and allow and encourage the free flow of market value.[ ~~As renowned economist Maynard Keynes stated, perhaps inspired by the trust-busting days of U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt, "The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones~~](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]." Information needs to be allowed to flow without any restrictions, and ideas have to be rewarded based on their value and merit. When this state is reached, our collective knowledge will then grow faster, due to the promoted innovation and progress. The free market is a vast and expansive field where seeds of ideas are planted. In such a field, only the strongest or most viable seeds will sprout and grow, while the weaklings die naturally. This is a market that simply mimics Nature itself.&#x20;
