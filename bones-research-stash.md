## HEGEL&#x20;

* the profound changes that interest Hegel have been produced,.. by our becoming more conscious of our freedom and potential for self-determination, and more aware of the way in which that freedom is to be realized and fulfilled in the world... this process of growing self-awareness has an endpoint: namely when we become fully conscious of the fact that all human beings have the potential to be free, self-determining agents8
* In Hegel's view, therefore, certain shifts in cultural perspective have resulted not merely&#x20;  from a change in human self-understanding, but rather from a deepening of human self understanding. Such shifts constitute, for him, a progressive development towards the&#x20;  truth. They represent humanity's increasing awareness of the essential nature of our own&#x20;  character, activity and thought- a growing self-awareness that brings with it a more adequate understanding of the world around us. 13
* ~~The fundamental&#x20;  advances in history - the emergence of the classical world and the dawn of Christianity,&#x20;  for example - are thus the result, for Hegel, of mankind's becoming more aware of itself&#x20;  as freely self-determining and thereby actually coming to be more freely self-determining&#x20;  in history. 14~~
* ~~He believes that the emergence of humanity's sense of its own freedom of critical reflection marks a real development or progress in human self-awareness 15~~
* History is thus the process whereby human beings come to new levels of awareness of their&#x20;  freedom, of their productive, active nature, and thereby produce new forms of social and&#x20;  political life. The human activity of self-production is, therefore, at the same time the&#x20;  process of self-discovery and self-revelation - a fusion of making oneself and finding&#x20;  oneself, of acting and of coming to know, which is perhaps best expressed in English by&#x20;  the word 'self-realization' 18
* the true character of human existence means learning that what we are is the process of producing and determining ourselves. means learning that this process of self production is itself the process of coming to understand more dearly that we are&#x20;  self-producing beings. we learn that it is above all through changes in our&#x20;  self-understanding that we actually make ourselves into and so become something new: we&#x20;  produce ourselves precisely through developing a fuller understanding that we do so 21
* Hegel believes that the tremendous&#x20;  changes which have been taking place in Europe and America since the 1770s and 1780s&#x20;  are ultimately the result of one thing: human beings have at last become aware that&#x20;  their essence lies in freedom and self determination.26
* We are now fully aware that we are free, self-determining beings and that we&#x20;  \
  &#x20;are free above all as rational, thinking beings28
* Free, self-determining philosophy shows us that human consciousness is impelled by its own inherent logic or 'Idei to develop an aware ness of its own freedom over time, and so to generate the process of history. However, such philosophy also recognizes that, if certain things had been different- if disease or some other natural disaster had destroyed human civilization, or if people such as Caesar or Napoleon had never been born - then the emergence of freedom (and of history as we understand it) could have been delayed or even been deferred indefinitely.47
