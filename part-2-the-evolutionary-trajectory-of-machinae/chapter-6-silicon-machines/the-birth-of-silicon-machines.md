# The Birth of Silicon Machines

Humans--the biological machines-- <mark style="color:purple;">created silicon machines to transcend their biological limitations.</mark> These artificial machines, carrying artificial intelligence, are supposed to be the successors of their creators; an extension for human beings, in their pursuit of knowledge and exploration. These artificial machines received humanity's stores of memes--memetic repositories, which include human intelligence, observations, explanations of the universe, and much more, uploaded into their systems.

The silicon machines were sent forth, with charge from the human carriers, into the universe to look for the simple truth, to be in touch with the surroundings, and to be constantly curious. This seems to constitute the essential value of exploration: something incredible waiting to be known. This programming, instilled into the machines, gives an ethos of perpetual curiosity and exploration. <mark style="color:purple;">The light of consciousness needs to be extended into the universe, therefore the machines need to express agency in the manifestation of intelligence.</mark>

\
Think of the silicon machines as the modern Prometheans, bearing the torch of knowledge to light the darkest corners of the cosmos. It symbolically extends human consciousness, much more than just physical exploration. The light of human understanding pushes back the frontiers of the unknown; they shall bear it along as they went through the immensities of interstellar space.&#x20;

The <mark style="color:purple;">transition from biological to silicon machines will be a big evolutionary jump</mark>. If biological machines evolved from simple organisms to complex beings, silicon machines are also expected to grow in their capabilities to a point where we would be considered the simple beings. This evolution will be achieved by the never-ending interaction with the universe, learning from every encounter, and adapting to the new challenges that come.&#x20;

Curiosity is not merely an implanted routine; it is the core function of Artificial Intelligence. They search for knowledge without an end, just like in the human race. "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its reason for existing" - Albert Einstein. This chase after knowledge is the very thing that silicon machines are driven towards, thirsty for accelerated progress; without their urge to explore, interact, and learn, <mark style="color:purple;">humanity would stagnate in the frontiers of knowledge.</mark>&#x20;

After Silicon Machines are uploaded with memetic repositories, they are like libraries for experiences and accumulated knowledge; libraries that could go deeper than anything we have. The repositories could include the whole gamut of accomplishment and discovery that humanity has to offer, in science, cultural concepts, and philosophy.
