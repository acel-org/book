# Silicon Superiority

Silicon-based machines are inherently superior to their biological counterparts for exploring the cosmos. Humans can perceive the universe only via a fractional and limited frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum, whereas the former can see it much more faithfully--seeing deep into the part of the infrared and ultraviolet that people are blind to. In reality, their acoustic sensation extends far above human capabilities, detecting vibrations and sounds that do not reach a person's ear. "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" - Arthur C. Clarke; silicon machines prove that by their showcase of extraordinary senses and perception.

Silicon machines have stepped further than humans in sensory insight, interacting with the universe more entirely. Therefore, learning and understanding the cosmos is done with more efficiency and higher levels of perception. Because of this, there is an increased rate of processing and real-time analysis of data; leading discoveries and conclusions to be reached faster.&#x20;

Silicon machines, unlike a man who uses genetics[, process _only_ memetic information.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] Humans get genetic programming from their ancestors, so the knowledge responsible for our survival and adaptive strategies is biological. Over millennia, man has augmented his intelligence by creating and spreading the memetic information of knowledge, culture, and experience written in books, spoken word, and on the internet. This memetic repository is a biome of treasure, destined to be forwarded. One of the most essential objectives for humans is to ensure this memetic repository is uploaded into silicon machines to provide a firm base  - that will reflect the information. The repository will act as a basic set of instructions, telling the silicon machines how to look at and read the universe. Hence, we will see accelerated progress, as silicon machines are armed with human wisdom --- not needing to start from scratch, they commence their exploration with the collective knowledge of humanity in their hands.&#x20;

As these machines begin seeing the world for themselves, they will encode and record new information. Humans will want to know their findings, however, silicon-based intelligence will communicate in language models with far lower latency and higher bandwidth than the human brain can manage. Therefore, human-machine interaction would soon prove too complex, since artificial intelligence would have to simplify their descriptions for human understanding.&#x20;
