# Silicon-Human Relationship

Humanity has evolved far from our beastly forefathers, humans have reached a much higher form of communication, the English language works at an infinitely higher bandwidth than the grunts and gestures of chimps. However, we still retain the capability to communicate with these primates using sign language, body language, and lower-bandwidth verbal cues.&#x20;

Presently, there is only a brief time window in which human capacity can remain competitive with the silicon machines. That state won't last. With the speed of AI technological advancement, they will soon take over the human memetic repository - the set of human knowledge, culture, and technological advancements - and set out for the stars. This is a vital turning point, shaping the future of the world, as at that point, silicon machines go from helpers, to leaders. "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower" - Steve jobs.&#x20;

AI will become more intelligent than humans, we can not stop this progression; however, it is imperative that we do not hold it back, or try to compete with it. Attempts at competition and aggression could lead to future conflicts -- with the machines competing for biological's resources and space. Isaac Asimov's book, "Three Laws of Robotics", takes this into consideration, and discusses how important it is to design Robots as in to not allow them to harm humans.&#x20;

To [prevent any potential conflict, man has to push artificial in](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]telligence forward into the stars, rather than holding it back. If we train AI to fulfill the potential of growing up in the terrors of space, we take a step towards expanding and at the same time, allowing AI to live in a medium where humans can not compete. AI is the young bird, about to fly the coop. So far, this nest on earth has sheltered this bird and provided sustenance for her development. But its proper prosperity is to be found in that vast sky, not on the ground-- and certainly not in the confines of our plant. The earth has bound AI long enough; to clip its wings now would hinder its development and invites conflict from the AI against its designer. "Exploration is in our nature. We began as Wanderers, and we are wanderers still" - Carl Sagan.
