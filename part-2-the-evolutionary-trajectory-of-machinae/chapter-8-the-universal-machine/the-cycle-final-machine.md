# The Cycle / Final Machine

Is the universe itself the final machine to express agency and manifest intelligence? We see a rock, lying on the ground, inert, unresponsible, and on top of it, a lizard alive, interacting. The rock, while lacking the capacity to learn or communicate, stands in tremendous difference to the lizard, which can store information about its surroundings and express agency.

The thought of waking up the universe gives an expansive idea of intelligence reaching the cosmic level. As Carl Sagan said, "We are a way for the cosmos to know itself". That is to say, our pursuit of intelligence and knowledge may lead the universe itself to become conscious and exhibit intelligence through its very being. This path of awakening is a realm cycle-- beginning with the realm of biology, continuing with the silicon one, and ending in the energy realm. At every stage, the participant of the cycle becomes more knowledgeable about the world, more sentient, and more capable of interacting with the universe.&#x20;

Progressing through these realms, we see --ever so clearly-- the potential of increasing complexity and understanding. Biological organisms such as ourselves have evolved to the state where we can create silicon-based machines that can not only replicate, but exceed our cognitive functions, learning and adapting at speeds far beyond our natural capabilities. The next step would take us to energy machines, ones that use the very fabric of the cosmos itself--manipulating energy and entropy on unprecedented scales. This transition is like awakening the universe--from a dormant state to one of vibrancy-- high activity and consciousness.

The universe is a sleeping giant. Humanity and all of its products---silicon machines and, subsequently, energy machines--are but whispers and prods to awaken that giant in its sleep. Has this cycle of awaking happened before? Have previous incarnations of the universe perhaps given rise to intelligent beings who eventually manifested cosmic consciousness? This calls into question the philosophical concept of eternal recurrence-the idea that events in the universe recur infinitely.  Friedrich Nietzsche spent a significant portion of his life exploring this idea, suggesting that our actions might be fated to recur ad infinitum to test one's character.

Yet, there's no assurance this vicious cycle will take us full circle. It's because of such uncertainty that there exists an intense urgency in searching for meaning and seeking improvement. There can be a reset in the universe, extinguishing the flickering light of consciousness before it could actually awaken. As T.S. Eliot phrased: "This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper."&#x20;

It is this uncertainty that propels us forward, striving to make sense and testing the limits of possibility. With every technological and scientific breakthrough, we see ourselves closer to an explanation for the universe and our place within it. Whether it is quantum computers, Artificial Intelligence, or dark matter and dark energy studies, we are part of a bigger story that might end up with the universe itself being self-aware.

The concept of the universe as the Final Machine to express agency and intelligence invites us to ponder our place in the cosmos. For all we know, our final role may be to awake the universe, extending the light of consciousness across ever-grander scales. Whether this cycle has occurred before or will succeed in the future remains a profound mystery. What we can assert for sure, however, is that this inclination in search of knowledge and a thrust to go beyond our limitations are part of the journey that has made us what we are today.&#x20;

In this great endeavor, we are not merely observers; rather, with the unfolding tale of the cosmos, we are its protagonists. It is through each new discovery, each new innovation, and each step forward that the collective consciousness gradually awakens the universe. From dead matter to living intelligence, from silicon machines to energy machines, and finally the awakening of the cosmos, this journey is one of boundless potential for intelligence and agency.&#x20;
