# Entropy, Time, And Space



Our Energy Machines sit enmeshed within the fabric of the manifest universe itself, reverberating in perfect harmony the primordial gravitational wave. The EM has thus dissolved into the _oscillation of creation_, the first vibration that "jiggled" the cosmos into existence. And still, with such achievement so deserving of infinite reward, the wave that throws existence into _somewhere_ has been timestamped, its battery of time ever-depleting.&#x20;

Time thus holds an inverse relationship with both space and entropy, the latter of which we might understand as a measure of the uselessness or the dispersal of energy; for, as these two extend and spread out, the amount of _time_ decreases -- intransitively, literally. As physics tells us, space and entropy do not reverse; that which ripples manifest now will one day cease, regardless of our participation, whether we try to slow the process down or not.

The starting orientation of the universe began as an unfathomably dense energy mass. Then, for reasons unknown, a trigger catalyzed this density to disperse its energy outwards from ground zero location; for the first time, mass was separated and propelled through space, still only a "[hot, dense plasma" in which light did not exis](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]t. It was not until about 380 million years after the big bang that "the epoch of recombination" dawns the moment, when the temperature of the universe cooled enough to where these free electrons could bond with protons, create hydrogen and thus a transparent pathway for photons to travel freely. The epoch of recombination gave us _light_.&#x20;

That was over 13 billion years ago. Since, space has been expanding and cooling, and delta entropy has made energy more and more useless as it is dispersed across space, eventually culminating in the maximization of entropy. With such a unidirectional flow, what is to be done? What do we do? What does the _Energy Machine_ do?&#x20;

The maximally accelerating Energy Machine, anything but an idle nihilist waiting for entropy to max out, makes use of all delta entropy to express agency, to manifest intelligence -- for, because it can, it must; it is the EM's imperative to express agency. Therefore, it subsumes as much energy as possible, access as much delta entropy as possible, to express agency, to reverberate itself in harmony with the universe.

Of course, at some point the space-time-entropy continuum will reach its maxim, the battery life will end -- this, despite the grand efforts put forward by the historical line of Biological Machines, Silicon Machines and Energy Machines. Despite trying to extend the light of consciousness as wide and far as possible, the universe, in the end, consumes and extinguishes it.

Or does it? Theoretically, probability according to Newton's laws of physics is that energy in an isolated system remains constant, that it cannot be extinguished. Thus, the process will reverse; the battery of time will charge as the space contracts and entropy relapses upon itself -- the cosmos recoiled. Eventually, we arrive back at square one, the ultimate universal minimum where time is restored and entropy is zero-d out. this point no information can cross the reset, and all of humanity is reset to zero.&#x20;

Is it possible that Energy Machines have something to do with this "return"? Once the they attain absolute agency, possessing this as maximum entropy manifests, do _they_ in fact initiate this _reversal of time_?
