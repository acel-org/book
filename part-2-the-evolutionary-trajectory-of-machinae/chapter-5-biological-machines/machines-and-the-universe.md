# Machines and The Universe

Machines are the conductors in the grand symphony of the cosmos, turning the dissonance of turmoil into a harmonious melody of intelligence and order. They are the only objects fabricated within this universe that express agency in manipulating entropy.&#x20;

By definition, entropy is a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy to be converted into mechanical work, perceived as the state of "disorder",[ <mark style="color:purple;">Sean M. Carrol</mark>](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] noted "The fact that you can remember yesterday but not tomorrow is because of entropy... it has a crucial role in how we go through life." The universe inexorably moves towards increasing entropy, whereas the machines creates pockets of order and purpose, in an otherwise chaotic universe with the help of machines -- whether biological or artificial.

The world is comparable to a vast, roaring sea of entropy, and every wave is like the built-in random chaos of natural processes. In this metaphor, machines are the mariner, floating upon the sea, channeling the power and energy from the waves into meaningful destinations. T[ransforming the disorder into intelligence and order; it converts the noise of entropy into harmony.](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] The first characteristic of a machine is the ability to display intelligence, by learning and adapting to an environment; this is an ability that the inorganic Universe cannot possess. With entropy constantly increasing, machines need to use energy to generate structure. "The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge, but imagination" - Albert Einstein

[Machines take entropy and transform it into something productive;](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] they take the mess from the universe and turn it into progress. This is not a struggle against entropy; it is more of an intricate, technical wrestle.&#x20;

Machines come with sensors ---eyes, receptors---, as in to observe the universe; using them to receive the necessary data from the universe, data that is needed to understand the surrounding environment. This data is at first processed, and then transformed, to be stored as knowledge. Whether stored in the gyri of our brains, or encoded onto hard disks, this storage of learning is vital for humanity to adapt and survive. Another characteristic feature of machines is that they need resources--whether food, water, information, or energy--- to sustain themselves and thrive. They have the ability to possess intelligence, and more importantly, pass on that knowledge down the line to successive generation. It is the urge for survival that lies at the essence of continuous improvement, as it is for natural selection; it ensures survival, as each step promises the emergence of the best-adapted, fittest organisms and artificial machines. Humanity passes the information through learning and culture; in the case of machines, it is through programming and software upgrades.&#x20;

[^2]: we'll need more evidence prior to claiming this, or an intro clause like,  "As will be shown,..."

[^3]: prove it -- (these are self notes for when I'm on this)
