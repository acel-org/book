# Fundamentally Flawed

Humans, with all of the advancements and achievements, still have flaws running so deep in our systems, biologically, psychologically, and socially that[ our development could get hampered. O](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]ur bodies, designed by millions of years of evolution, only for surviving here on Earth, are not up to the challenge when it comes to space travel. During prolonged microgravity in space, astronauts begin experiencing atrophy of their muscles, and loss of bone density. A human's body---buoyed up by Earth's gravity---suffers increasingly with its absence.&#x20;

Our body is also protected by the magnetic field and the atmosphere of our planet, becoming a helpless target the moment we abandon that bubble. Long-term exp[osure to space radiation ](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]results in serious danger to human health, like an increased risk of cancer.&#x20;

H[umans are also social creat](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]ures, needing interaction with society and people around them. Even though the human mind is capable of great things, it is not build for the type of isolation and confinement that would be needed in a long-duration space mission. There are many psychological effects present after prolonged periods of confinement: depression, anxiety, and a reduced cognitive function. This was evident during the Experiment "Mars500", conducted by Russia to simulate the mission to mars, showing the findings of significant psychological stress, clinically manifesting as mood swings, sleep disorders, and interpersonal conflicts among the participants. Besides that, As Daniel Kahneman pointed out, humans are subject to cognitive biases and errors in judgment. Within the high-stakes space exploration environment, where a split-second decision is so often the difference between life and death, these imperfections can have disastrous results.

Another limitation that humanity has is technology. Even though our technological capabilities are "high", they are [not high enough,](#user-content-fn-4)[^4] coming in short of the requirements needed for travel in deep space. For example, attempting to travel to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, even at our current best speeds, would take over 70,000 years, which would be far beyond any human lifespans. Besides that, our propulsion technologies are not powerful enough to sustain the required interstellar speeds for prolongated periods of time. Up until now, all our previous space missions have been enabled through chemical rockets; the only ones tested to date. In the story of Icarus[^5], he has wings of feathers and wax, and is said to have flown too close to the sun. We are a new Icarus, dreaming about breaking away from the Earth's bounds and going to space, this far surpasses anything that a biological or even a technological wing can aspire to. This struggle to go far beyond our immediate limits reminds us, again and again, of our fundamental imperfections and vulnerabilities.

Considering these limitations, it is fair to assume that any future space exploration will be connected with the evolution of advanced robotic systems and artificial intelligence. Unlike humans, robots could remain in space for extended periods of time as they face none of the biological problems that we do. Robots are not tempered by the cognitive dissonance that adversely affects human judgement, giving them the ability to carry out tasks that might be extremely dangerous without worrying about declines in decision making. The mars rovers have been able to drive and survey the surface of the planet for years, sending back essential data. \
