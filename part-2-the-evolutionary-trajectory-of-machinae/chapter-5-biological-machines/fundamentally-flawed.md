# Fundamentally Flawed

Humans, for all our towering achievements and remarkable advancements that have come to define our species, are marred by flawed aspects of our biology, psychology, and social constructs to such an extent that they threaten to stymie any progress whatsoever. These imperfections, though natural to our evolutionary design, have now emerged as detriments to our quest to transcend the confines of Earth. We find ourselves unusually unprepared for anything beyond our terrestrial home as a product of millions of years of natural selection (Gould, 1989).

Where our bodies, designed with pinpoint accuracy over millions of years to thrive under the grip of Earth's gravity, begin to work against us once space is entered. It is in this weightlessness of space that the very muscles which help our bodies move begin to atrophy—waste away (Hawkey, 2003). The density of our bones, too, is reduced, silently giving up all resistance to the pull of gravity (Vico et al., 2000). The human body, strong on Earth, grows weak and helpless in space. We also leave behind in this journey an invisible shield of protection from cosmic radiation—the protective magnetic field and atmosphere of Earth—as we cross the threshold into space. Without this protective shielding, our bodies are bombarded by high-energy particles deep into tissues, increasing the risk of cancers and other degenerative diseases (Cucinotta et al., 2001).

Yet, the physical degradation is but half of the tale. Humans are, by nature, social beings—hardwired to interact, belong, and be sociable. Isolation and confinement associated with long-duration spaceflight missions go against our hardwired need for socialization. Most of the psychological problems ensued by prolonged solitude include depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline (Sandal et al., 2011). The psychological stress level was notably high in the Mars500 experiment, a simulated manned mission to Mars created by Russians, which manifested itself in mood swings, sleep disorders, and conflicts with fellow companions (Suedfeld et al., 2009).

Even in the protective womb of the Earth's atmosphere, the cognitive biases that have been part and parcel of our evolutionary history are always with us, informing every decision. Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman has, of course, put vast amounts of ink to paper documenting the sundry cognitive biases—overconfidence, availability heuristic, and so on and so forth that plague human thinking (Kahneman, 2011). Any one can prove lethal in the rarefied, high-stakes environment of space exploration. One moment of overconfidence, a single misjudgment based on faulty memory, makes all the difference between life and death in the pitiless vacuum of space (Leach, 2004).

Now, let us imagine the astronauts in the Apollo 13 mission. The famous "Houston, we have a problem" statement described just how fragile it all really is when sending human explorers into space. Our bodies are put to battle, but even our limited cognitive abilities are brought up against the fight. Every decision made under extreme time pressure and with very little spare time bears the responsibility of life or death (Lovell & Kluger, 2006).

Even as we dream of interstellar travel, our technological prowess falls grossly short from what it would take for such a journey. The nearest star, Proxima Centauri, lies over 4.24 light-years away. At our current best speeds, we would reach it in more than 70,000 years—a span far beyond any human lifetime (Shklovskii & Sagan, 1966).

Although advanced, our propulsion technologies are not good enough to give us the capability of sustained efforts of interstellar travel. All space missions undertaken so far have used chemical rockets—a very old technology by cosmic time. While such powerful rockets were able to escape the clutches of Earth's gravity, they still remain severely crippled in terms of fuel and energy efficiency (Spudis, 2016). On a metaphorical level, our situation would be comparable to that of Icarus as he flew closer to the sun with his wings made of wax and feathers. We, too, dream of reaching the stars, but our wings, our technologies, are not yet strong enough to take us beyond the bonds of Earth.

With these inherent limitations, future space exploration is in all likelihood to depend on the creation of advanced robotic systems and artificial intelligence. Unlike humans, robots are impervious to bodily and psychic strains that afflict humanity. They do not suffer muscle atrophy, bone loss, or cognitive decline. If necessary, robots can stay in space forever, performing tasks that would be extremely hazardous for the human explorers. For example, the Mars rovers have been able to run around the surface of Mars for years, sending back invaluable data sans need to rest or eat (NASA, 2020).

These machines are at the vanguard in our efforts to go out and understand the cosmos, unencumbered by the biological bonds that restrain us. But Carl Sagan once warned, "It is suicidal to create a society dependent on science and technology in which hardly anybody knows anything about science and technology" (Sagan, 1996). As we continue literally to hand more of the exploratory responsibilities over to machines, we cannot be blind or forgetful of the ingenuity and knowledge that brought us here. We must invite a balance between our ingenuity as humans and robotic capability as we press into this new frontier.

Ultimately, our embracing of space travel does force us to face some fairly fundamental flaws in our existences. Repeatedly, we are reminded that we are biological machines—beautifully complex within our limitedness. Our bodies, minds, and technologies are greatly unprepared for interstellar travel. It is in these limitations, however, that new innovations have birthed and given way to relentless pursuit. In this struggle, our humanity glows at its brightest.

We may never wholly overcome our imperfections, but in the striving to do so, we extend what is possible. Just as Icarus flew too close to the sun, knowing the risks, we too have to dare to dream beyond our immediate reach. And in that daring, we find stored the very core of what it means to be human—a species defined not by its limitations, but by its endless quest to transcend them.
