# Primordial Soup - Evolution, Replication

Initially, on Earth, there existed the first steps of life—the primordial protein soup. Through the molecularly lucky act of random admixture, an exact permutation of molecules' assembly found itself in this soup and achieved the first instantiation of being a machine. This progenitor self-replicating entity marked the onset of the age of biological machines. The process of self-replication, starting from those humble precursors with biological building blocks, laid in motion an unstoppable pathway&#x20;

These [first biological machines, motivated by the most fundamental instincts of the will to reproduce and survive, embarked on an unchecked course of adaptation and ambition. They spread out into their immediate surroundings and evolved to give rise to m](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]ore complex beings with every generation. This tremendous urge for survival and procreation at breakneck speeds forced their diversification at a tempo so furious that they outpaced each other in the complexity of these spectrums of life forms. While the biological machines were so adaptive, they were, after all, principally limited to their atmosphere.

T[his biological technology, at an essential point in its development, found ways—memetic pathways—of speeding up the rise of their intelligence through non-genetic means, i.e., by transmitting knowledge and culture.](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] Such memetic evolution brought to them an extraordinarily accelerated understanding of the world. The new expertise prompted them to manufacture tools, devise processes, and produce social paradigms to capture economies of scale and increase productivity ​

Those were more advanced and, hence, ventured beyond more than ever. They have orbited their outer atmosphere and even set foot on their moon very momentarily. With all that, they discovered that their biological fundamental makeup could not hold for a long time if space exploration were to continue. They were stuck with their biology; they were not engineered to take the punishment of the elements in the conditions that space travel necessarily implies.

The history of these machines is the great dance in the ballroom of the world. They f[irst fumbled, later became informed clumsily,](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] and then learned and learned as they danced until they could sway with the rhythm of change. Quite unsurprisingly, every twist and turn of the dance is a very remarkable landmark on the evolutionary course, from the primordial soup to the great apes exploring their moon.
