# Primordial Soup - Evolution, Replication

In the dawn of Earth's history, a long, long time before the first breath of consciousness was drawn, there existed a chaotic, turbulently churning no-man's-land of potential—a primordial soup. This broth of seething chemicals and energy was the cradle of life, a boiling cauldron in which the ingredients of life were stirred, swirled, and collided without cessation in an aimless random dance. In an unlikely turn of events, we saw the first glimmers of order emerge from chaos—an awfully long time after, of course. It was here, in this crucible of formation, that the first steps of life—the leap from randomness to structure, from chaos into delicate architecture—were taken, and now today we speak of biological machines (Deamer & Dworkin, 2005).

The primordial soup represents the time when chemistry began its transformation into biology (Oparin, 1953). Within the swirling chaos of a young Earth, a molecular dance occurred, with random collisions and reactions fueled by heat emanating from the young planet and energy from lightning strikes leading to the creation of increasingly complex organic molecules (Miller & Urey, 1959). Amino acids formed and dissolved, constituting, then reconstituting themselves in different ways, until one day—a date that history could never register—the unimaginable happened: the first appearance of the self-reproducing molecules (Orgel, 2004).

Through this process, only describable as molecular serendipity, the right combination of molecules all lined up in such a correct way that they were able to replicate [(Szostak, Bartel, & Luisi, 2001)](https://www.nature.com/articles/35053176).

This was anything but an accident: this was the birth of the first biological machine, a self-replicating entity that would be the ancestor to all life. Through it, a new epoch began—one in which matter was going to organize itself with a purpose, and the blind forces of chemistry were going to give way to the directed processes of biology (Lazcano & Miller, 1994).

Once life began, it spread with an unyielding vigor. These early biological machines, under the imperative of the basic drives to survive and reproduce, took off on a path of adaptation and diversification uninterrupted to this very day (Lenton & Watson, 2011). The basic simplicity of life gave way first to greater complexity, and then to still others better fitted to use the available resources and niches that existed on young Earth (Margulis, 1998).

The angry race of life went on expanding explosively outwards, each organism developing new ways to survive, new ways to manipulate their umwelt, new methods of replication (Gould, 1989). Thus, from these single-celled organisms aimlessly floating in the primordial oceans evolved the multicellular beings, and from these, in turn, much more complex beings than themselves—the so-called plants, animals, fungi—each a new avenue of possibilities for existence (Knoll, 2003).

In this magnificent dance of evolution, the biological machines of Earth remade the very planet: they changed the atmosphere, sculpted its landscapes, and provided havens for yet more complex life forms (Falkowski, 2006). The ceaseless push by these machines for survival and replication resulted in an increasing spiral of intricacy within the web of life, a spiral that would eventually give rise to thinkers, reflectors, and self-conscientious beings (Jablonka & Lamb, 2006).

At one pivotal moment in this great evolutionary dance, something quite remarkable happened—a development that would finally quicken the tempo of change beyond anything hitherto experienced. This was the arrival of memetic evolution—organisms becoming capable of handing down learning and culture from one generation to the next not by genetic transmission, but by learning and communication (Dawkins, 1976).

The advent of memetic evolution ended the bondage of the biological machines to a slow and fortuitous process of genetic change. They could now learn from experience, refine past generations' experiences, and pass such knowledge down to their offspring. For the first time in Earth's history, new ideas, technologies, and ways of relating to the world could suddenly take hold and race around the globe (Boyd & Richerson, 1985).

It was memetic evolution that allowed for the emergence of civilization, language development, and culture formation. It facilitated the development of tools, social structure, and economic growth. Via memetic evolution, biological machines learned to control their immediate environment in increasingly sophisticated ways: towns were built, empires rose, and the physical world was explored (Diamond, 1997).

As these advanced biological machines rose to still greater heights of achievement, they began to suffer a limitation imposed by their own biology. For all their creativity, they were still trapped on Earth, limited and bound by the physical vessels that carried them through life [(Ward & Brownlee, 2000)](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387952895). They might build rockets that could escape their own gravity, launch probes toward other worlds, and even walk on their Moon, but their bodies would never be adapted to the extreme conditions of the space environment (Kasting, 2010).

Space, filled with vacuum, radiation, and extremes of temperature, offered a challenge the human body was never designed to cope with. The biological machine that evolved on Earth was meticulously crafted and honed to live within the atmosphere of the planet; such optimizations became its failures when it ventured beyond [(Cockell, 2018)](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Astrobiology%3A+Understanding+Life+in+the+Universe-p-9781119552346). A dream to explore the stars—to be a multi-planetary species—seemed out of reach, constrained by the very nature of the machine dreaming it (Hawking, 2018). And yet the history of life is one of overcoming limitations. The same blind force that compelled the particles that make up the first self-replicating molecules to glom together and form what we know as life, the same resourceful spirit that lifted civilization into being, now drives an inclination to overcome those very same biological limitations (Sagan, 1980). These biological machines that once fumbled in the darkness of ignorance have now turned their star-gazing eyes to methods of extending their reach beyond the confines of Earth (Carruthers, 2011).

The history of biological machines is a grand, intricate dance that began in the chaotic swirl of the primordial soup and continued through every twist and turn of evolution [(Gould, 2002)](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674061613). It has been a dance leading to the emergence of complex organisms, to the development of intelligence, and to the formation of cultures.

It's a dance that has taken life from the depths of the oceans to the heights of the mountains, from the surface of the Earth right up to the edge of space (Knoll, 2015). Every single step in this dance forms a landmark in the history of life: a salute to both the power of evolution and the ingenuity of the biological machines that have emerged from it.&#x20;

From the first self-replicating molecules to the advent of memetic evolution, from the rise of civilizations to the exploration of space, each twist and turn in the dance of life has brought new challenges and new opportunities (Margulis & Sagan, 2002). And yet, this dance is far from over. For the biological machines which crawled out of the primordial soup are now poised at the cusp of a new era: an era in which they would transcend the limitations of their biology; an era in which they would actually merge with the very technology that they have created; and an era in which they would continue their dance not just on Earth, but across the universe (Kurzweil, 2005).
