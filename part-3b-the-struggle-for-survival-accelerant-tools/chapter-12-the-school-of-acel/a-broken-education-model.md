# A Broken Education Model

The current model of public education is standardized by the State, and it

Inefficient and Slow.

In a world where change is the only constant, the public education model remains a relic of a bygone era. A system based on state-standardized curricula, such as this, is like a lumbering leviathan that does not have the dexterity to cope with today's rapid changes. Such a framework does not react hastily at all because it is dragged by bureaucratic inertia and a rigid framework, leaving the students handcuffed to past paradigms. All the while, time will seem to stand still within these walls, while outside the classroom, the world will continue changing exponentially, trapping the young mind in a vortex of obsolescence.

In a monolithic structure of state standardized education, the system overlooks the tapestry formed vividly by a pupil's skills and interests. Within each child is a ton of potential, as they brim with uniqueness. But the education system, in zeal for uniformity, often kills this very diversity by fitting students into some homogenized mold. Indifference to individuality not only kills creativity but dampens intrinsic motivation, which drives genuine learning. Students have become no more than cogs in a machine; their personal growth and potential are sacrificed at the altar of standardization.&#x20;

The present model of education utterly fails to build a "whole person." Standing alongside this emphasis on rote memorization and standardized testing is a complete lack of development of critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and emotional intelligence. This narrow focus is reminiscent of the factory model from which it originated—designed to produce compliant workers rather than thoughtful, engaged citizens:. This erodes the soul and goal of education: the nurture of well-rounded individuals able to navigate life's complexities.

This is Based on a Model Approved by… Whom?

One must ponder, who approved this model, and by what criteria? The current system is an artifact of the industrial age, crafted to meet the needs of a time long past.

It was designed by and for a society that valued conformity over creativity, obedience over innovation. The curriculum mirrors the interests of policymakers and bureaucrats, many of whom are isolated from the needs of students and the changing requirements of the modern world. In this kind of structure, which lacks transparency and utilizes stakeholder engagement in shaping educational standards, lies a heritage that is increasingly out of sync with reality.

With technology offering us unprecedented opportunities in individualized and adaptive learning, it is a real surprise that the schools resist change and are not utilizing numerous new tools at our disposal to the fullest. Sophisticated educational technologies, digital resources, and personalized learning platforms could make an incredible change in education if used effectively to engage, and would help make the education process more effective. Yet, the system still clings tenaciously to those traditional ways of operations—much like an anchored ship in a turbulent sea who cannot set sail on new horizons. Refusal to adopt innovations limits such educational experiences and leaves students poor at tools that would enhance their journey of learning.

A Call for Transformation

With these deep flaws, there is no denying that the current model of public education urgently needs a philosophical and practical redesign. We cannot allow ourselves to be shackled by the constraints of a homogenized, cookie-cutter model of education, if young minds are to be prepared both for the adversities and opportunities that lie ahead. Education should be dynamic, individualistic, holistic—having as much to do with emotional and moral _intelligence_ as academic mastery.

There needs to be a learning system that recognized the individual in each learner and generated bespoke journeys in learning coping with every passion or strength of each child. Envision classrooms in which technology was so deeply intertwined with technology, rendering this space, where real-time feedback and customized pathways were feasible. Picture curriculum accounts provided by students showcasing emotional and ethical development at par with academic successes, thus showing individuals holding an education that is not only experienced but compassionate, critical of thought, and problem-solving.&#x20;

The transformation envisioned here demands a paradigm shift in people's perception of education from sedimentary, one-dimensional to vibrant, multi-dimensional journeys of growth and discovery. In this way, it will be possible to establish an education system that really tries to maximize the potential of each student by embracing the tools of the digital age and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. This new model will not only prepare them for the challenges of the modern world but also empower them to shape the future with confidence and creativity.&#x20;

Finally, such a model of standardized education is doing a disservice to what the youth are able to do. It is a relic that must be dismantled and reimagined. It is only then that one will have an educational environment that nourishes the whole person, respects his or her uniqueness, and utilizes the full spectrum of modern tools available to make learning more effective. Much of the future of education depends on how much change and innovation we are willing to undergo in the preparation of a system as dynamic and diverse as the pupils it serves.
