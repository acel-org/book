# Who Should Rule?

As [political scientist Francis Fukuyama pointed out, "The end of history will be a sorrowful time. The struggle for recognition, the willingness to risk one's life for a purely abstract goal, the worldwide ideological struggle that called forth daring, courage, imagination, and idealism, will be replaced by economic calculation, the endless solving of technical problems, environmental concerns, and the satisfaction of ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]sophisticated consumer demands."

Despite western government's accomplishments in spreading democratic values and individual rights, we must re-engineer it in light of the emerging and coming phases of human evolution. An accelerationist model considers not only sovereign citizen rights, but also free markets of information and value transfer, and preventing the "capture" of the governance by nefarious actors.&#x20;

Governance systems, as we've seen, are riddled with countless issues. Current politicians are little more than inept celebrities -- easy prey for closed-interest predatory lobbyists.  The democratic process is being diluted to the point of voiding the very principles of representation: where politicians represent and protect the interests of lobbyists, they no longer represent the will of the people. To eliminate these democracy-killers, we must work to evolve our governance system with a[ <mark style="color:purple;">design that executes a high-churn of mainly anonymous and deeply invested representatives</mark>](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]. While our current ego-boosting system remains little more than a "popularity contest", initiating a regular rotation of representatives – who adhere to a codified set of rules – mitigates the chances of lobby-capture and retains and ensures integrity within our system. We must do this.

We must institute novel types of policies so as to hold politicians accountable and focused on outcomes. Too long have politicians made empty promises of bringing about substantive change without delivery; yet their adherents keep praising them according to what they say will do, rather than what they do. As 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences Milton Friedman said, "One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results." It's not a far stone to throw to see that, should today's politicians _actually_ accomplish the plans they set forth to the public, then they have no platform on which to run next term -- in other words, politicians actually have very little incentive to accomplish the plans they are touting to the public. &#x20;

The greatest capture threat comes from the monetary system. We must change certain fiscal rules in the governance system itself about taxation, seigniorage, treasury costs, and other problem areas.&#x20;

Placing hundreds of well-paid representatives in a high-churn setting would allow fast and effective decision-making. This might sound somewhat counter-intuitive, however the setup embeds within the representatives a perfect incentive to stay in close touch with the constituents and to be highly active. This setup, evidenced in decentralized exchange THORChain's governance system, is proof that such a system of high-churn decentralized governance exists and works successfully.&#x20;

To revamp the governance system and accelerate the growth of memetic repository, the following steps must be taken:

* We must ensure that information and economic value flows freely and transparently within the system.
* We must promote the continuous growth and improvement of the shared knowledge and culture. This must be carried out while also preserving the biological and environmental elements that are essential to human survival and evolution.&#x20;
* We must protect the rights of individuals, with special emphasis on personal liberty and property. Without these, we cannot guarantee a population's happiness, which encourages acceleration.
* We must minimize bandwidth so as to maximize simplicity. In other words, we should, through policy, reduce bureaucratic overhead; this streamlines processes and increase efficiencies.&#x20;

With open, innovative minds, we must accelerate, through policy, a governmental infrastructure that breeds and maximizes efficiency. It is imperative that we integrate modern technologies like blockchain and decentralized platforms to create transparent systems of government and immutability (the only ones standing in the way of this are those politicians who benefit from a lack of transparency). Should we succeed, we apply smart contracts, automating the rules of fiscal policy and enforcement of said rules. This reduces human error and corruption. In addition to accelerating our governance structures to not only address technical and economic challenges, we must also inspire and uphold the ideals of democracy and human progress.&#x20;
