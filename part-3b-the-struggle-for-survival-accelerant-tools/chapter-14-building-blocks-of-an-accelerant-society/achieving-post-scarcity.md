# Achieving Post-Scarcity

Naturally, the basic requisites of humankind—food, water, gas, and fuel—are all synthesized through the complex systems of our environment, yet somehow we find ourselves struggling over securing these resources at various levels. The roots of this struggle lie in a scarcity-driven mindset that evolved evolutionarily: survival depended on fighting for limited resources. But now, with the new technological progress standing before us, we have to reconsider our relationship with scarcity and the prospects for a post-scarcity future.

The natural world offers a large degree of self-maintenance cycles. Plants continually replenish oxygen through photosynthesis, water continually recycles through evaporation and precipitation, and sunshine offers basically an endless amount of fuel to drive this process. These are processes that are naturally manifested by the Earth's ecosystem. Our historical struggle for resources attests to the limitations of our past where technology and understanding were not up to par as to fully harness nature's abundance.

Philosophically, this struggle exposes the fundamental tug between the world as it is and the world as it might be. We have been taught to respect scarcity as a law we cannot break, yet it is something created by our perceptions and incapacities. In reconsidering scarcity, we reveal a future that finally unshackles human potential from the chains of competition for resources.

In the near-future, new ways of accessing, wielding, and distributing energy will usher in a post-scarcity age for humanity. As our reach extends into the cosmos, we must focus on developing sustainable processes to synthetically produce food, water, oxygen, and power. These technological developments, of which de novo synthesis of food is not least, are critical not just to long-term stays on other planets but have the potential to end resource limits here on Earth as well.

There will be a world wherein the marvels of technology transform deserts into rich lands, bringing to life those areas once cast aside as uninhabitable. Then, the Middle East and Australia—with their arid expanses—will revegetate and replenish themselves through inland seas and lush flora and fauna. This is not a fanciful hypothetical, but one that could postulate into realism after the harnessing of sophisticated technologies.

When scarcity of the basic resources can be eliminated, humanity will make an evolutionary step in its relation to Earth—from a parasitic to mutualistic relationship wherein the role of humans switches to guardianship over our planet. How that can be done is, with reorientation, by supplementing and nourishing the environment rather than destroying it. The successful evolution of human-environment symbiosis depends on the outcome of our ability to develop, process, and distribute energy efficiently.

The "I-Thou" relationship, discussed by philosopher Martin Buber was one of genuine dialogue and mutual respect. In a post-scarcity world, our relation to the Earth undergoes a change to an "I-Thou" relationship with our planet, where we dance with life and engage with the universe as more than an object to be manipulated for human purposes. This overall philosophical shift offers sustainability and stewardship, allowing us to prioritize and embody such values.

From our first appearance during the middle-late Pleistocene, humans have utilized their agency and biological improvisation to meet their needs. We first relied on environments to supply life-sustaining materials that were then biologically processed by bodies into energy. We later mimicked, in fuel-burning systems, that which biology accomplished—using whale oil and then fossil fuels to amplify productive capacities with much denser sources of energy.

Oil, at 42 joules per gram of energy density, really transformed the way we were able to store and use energy efficiently. If newfound nuclear power is offering an energy density of 500,000 joules per gram, then that is a quantum leap. Even amidst all concerns relating to its safety factor, it cannot be denied that nuclear energy indeed holds within itself the potentials to speed up human advancement.

In the view of Stephen Hawking, "I would like nuclear fusion to become a practical power source. It would provide an inexhaustible supply of energy, without pollution or global warming." Nuclear fusion stands to be the ultimate energy source with its unparalleled energy density and accessibility. Theoretically, fusion fuel is a memetic potentiality which could be found anywhere on earth; it behooves us to secure and integrate it into our collective repository of knowledge.

Finite energy is a false meme, kept alive by our reliance on fossil fuel sources and their limiting reality. In reality, the universe is an infinite reservoir of energy, vibrating at various states. Our work lies in learning and applying methods to access and harness this ever-present energy, keeping the light of consciousness bright.&#x20;

The philosopher Heraclitus once said, "The only constant in life is change." This axiom reminds us that our understanding of energy and scarcity hasn't been carved into stone, but changing as our knowledge and abilities do. In inventing a post-scarcity world, it will be necessary to embrace change first—challenge the status quo—and reimagine.

The achievement of post-scarcity requires a change at the very core of how we manage resources and how technology is developed. It will require revisiting not only our economic systems but also our priorities in sustainability and equitability over short-term gains and competitiveness. Embracing advanced technologies' potential, not just for capital and markets but for human progress: fostering innovative cultures and processes is likely to address basic human needs and free people to pursue higher individual aspirations and collective growth.

In such a future, humanity will transcend the limitations imposed by history and move into a new epoch where abundance will be the norm. This transition embodies a movement from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset, where creativity and collaboration replace competition and hoarding.

It will also take unparalleled cooperation among nations to create a post-scarcity world. The kind of cooperation—needed in developing technologies that further sustainability and resilience—has to go across borders and political lines. In so doing, we can foster an era of new peace and prosperity where the common good is greater than selfish interest.

The readiness to move within this new paradigm and innovate further must be passed on to coming generations, this can only be done if mankind invests in education and research. Empowering young minds for exploration and stretching the boundaries that exist in science and technology insures that the potential of a post-scarcity world remains a driving force in our collective evolution.

This journey to post-scarcity should have an appeal unto all of humanity. It is a call for us to reimagine our relationship with the Earth and each other, remove the constraints we set upon ourselves regarding the great potential with technology, and strive toward abundance and harmony in our destinies.

As we stand on this threshold of a new era, humanity must commit to the vision of a post-scarcity world, where the limitations of yesterday are replaced by the possibilities of tomorrow. Together, we can unlock the full potential of our species and ensure a sustainable, equitable future for generations to come. This will not be wishful thinking toward a vague dream but a guiding star that will show us our way ahead. As the philosopher and writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry stated, "As for the future, your task is not to foresee it, but to enable it." Let us enable such a future wherein post-scarcity is not only possible but inevitable—a future in which humankind will thrive in unison with itself and the universe.
