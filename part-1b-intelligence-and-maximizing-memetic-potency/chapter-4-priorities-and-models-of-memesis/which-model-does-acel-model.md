# Which Model Does ACEL Model?

## ACEL: Understanding its Memetic-Self

Naturally, these questions of religion are posited in excited consideration of the opportunity to frame ACEL, while it's still in its youth, as a _something_ — that is, to methodologically situate it in a recognizable, digestible, adoptable format. As one of the causes for its inception was _palatability_, its framework must obviously be just that; and, for something to be palatable, it must be, to some extent, _familiar_. In other words, people must be able to recognize _what ACEL is_ immediately upon their introduction with its words. There should be no ambiguity as to whether it is, or whether it understands itself as, a philosophy, a social activist movement, a belief system, etc. That there has been given no basis yet for any claim in this regard, we must engage in a process of discovery.&#x20;

In other words, the youthful ACEL must perform a thorough and public self-audit of its stock, its assets and liabilities; before it arrives to the stage and present public invitation, it needs to know if it can claim resonance with some historical mirror, so that it might learn from those memetically aligned structures and effectuate more change than otherwise by knowing itself more precisely. Emile Durkheim says of this in terms of "society", in _The Elementary Forms of Religious Life,_ "A society is not constituted simply by the mass of individuals who comprise it, the ground they occupy, the things they use, or the movements they make, but above all by the idea it has of itself" (425).  For, while _it_ might know where it's going, the simple fact is, interested persons must also know where _they_ are going should they decide to accept the invitation. Therefore, once we perform an open-air self-identification using a bottom-up methodology — i.e. there is no predetermined conclusion about what the final result will be — once we have laid out all of what ACEL is and is not, what it has to offer and what it does not, then it may line up its assets and liabilities and consider with which memetic framework might be best for it to self-identify, and if it is indeed worthy of a long fruitful half-life. We might again apply Durkheim's thinking of society to ACEL here, in that, if, from this audit, ACEL, "... is to be able to become conscious of itself and keep the sense it has of itself at the required intensity, it must assemble and concentrate. This concentration brings about an uplifting of moral life that is expressed by a set of ideal conceptions in which the new life thus awakened is depicted" (425).

## Acknowledging the Tricky Part First

Before beginning this self-audit, we must first, as adult readers, recognize that ACEL, despite having the structural legs of a tried and tested memetic powerhouse, is still in its early adolescence; it is full of intensity and potential, and it may not yet know itself to the full extent of, say, a mature philosophy. Patience and empathy are required with it; and, easily done by recollecting one's bygone teenage years, we might encourage ACEL to be deliberate in the steps it takes while carving out its own memetic path.&#x20;

This heeding is not a deceleration but a calling attention to focus; for, with so much buzzing intensity, all that charged, world-improving potential it can barely contain inside itself, it is imperative that ACEL not waste or dissipate itself with a lack of focus. It has too much to offer; and therefore it must put effort in ensuring that its energies are channeled, not frenetic; its aim sharpened, not erratic. If it can maintain these qualities through its launch into the memetic marketplace, then it stands to truly live the full extent of its half-life potential.

The reasoning behind this parental finger-wag is that ACEL, as has been shown, may wish to model itself after the Meme Infallible. By its whole nature, this would make sense: Why wouldn't ACEL aim to model itself on the longest half-life, the strongest, most infallible memetic structure that is Religion? In and of itself, this is no issue; however, historical context tells us differently, that in fact there is very tricky territory to navigate here, as historical precedent has shown us the following: that those thought systems who have previously attempted to mime the Meme Infallible, that is, Religion, quickly and inevitably fall into the pit of "cults". This is _not_ where we want ACEL, nor any memetic structure with such enormous potentiality to end up; it is not where ACEL _should_ wind up.&#x20;

Thus, the reasoning for the bottom-up self-audit. Does ACEL, in fact, have what it takes to fly over the "pit of cults" and successfully _mime the unmemeable_? Only the self-audit can say. Regardless of the outcome, a guiding question of this exercise might ask the following: If there were a way, what would it look like for any full-of-promising memetic structure go about applying what _is possible_ of the memetic strengths of Religion, _without_ ever claiming to be one, or _without_ ever being mistaken as an attempt to be one? Without further ado.&#x20;

## ACEL's Self-Audit&#x20;

This exercise aims to present the public with an open-air self-audit of ACEL's "Assets & Liabilities". The purpose behind this voluntary showing of strengths and areas for improvement is to model an organic and earnest pursuit to find the optimal memetic framework in which to propose situating ACEL. It should be reiterated here just before beginning that this is being performed via a bottom-up and first principles methodologies, that there is no prior knowledge or motive of where ACEL "ought to" belong prior to start. Any parallelisms are by pure providence. Let's begin.&#x20;

Note: As they are explained in depth elsewhere, Assets & Liabilities noted below will be explained only briefly. Primarily, the audit will direct readers to the relevant chapter(s) in which the topic's full delineation is rendered. (Notation: Part 4 Chp. 10 -> iv.10)

### Assets

#### A. Clearly Defined Purpose:&#x20;

* #### To secure and ensure that the evolution of humanity is seen through to its full completion.&#x20;
  * Of its own volition, ACEL created this its _raison d'etre_, and throughout itself retains focus on this foundational, frequently-referenced imperative. In fact, ACEL presents itself as being worthy of existence _only_ for this reason; it does not exist without this anchor.&#x20;
  * This purpose has easy buy-in and can, from a high level, be propagated easily.&#x20;
  * _Note: The full meanings of "Evolution"_ and "_Full Completion", as well as the actions_ _mentioned above are explicated in Part III of this text._&#x20;

#### B. Complete Metaphysical Picture:

* #### Grand Design: Biological Machines -> Silicon Machines -> Energy Machines -> Universal Machine (-> back to beginning?)
  * ACEL, despite its youth, has a full and complete metaphysical picture informed by historical biology, economic theory, quantum theory, process theory, religious studies, contemporary theory in the social sciences.
  * This includes but is not limited to:
    * A thorough attendance to the physical nature of reality and a consideration of our insignificance (vii.24).&#x20;
    * An ultimate reason for our existence and the universe as well as its antithesis (more, iii.8/9).
    * &#x20;A philosophical attendance to Time, Space, Reality, & Relationality (more, viii.8)

#### C. Praxis-Based Methodology:

* #### Accelerate human intelligence -> maximize human agency -> complete humanity's evolutionary cycle
  * ACEL posits many various, yet all essential, actionable approaches aligned with its purpose
  * Methods are heavily variegated. A small sample:
    * Promotion of Mises' economic ideals: free-market capitalism in all realms of exchange (iv.11)
    * Maintain peace at all costs with Biological-Silicon Machines (iii.7, vi.all)
    * Intentionality in genetic and memetic reproduction (ii.4)
    * Initiate alternative schooling system (v.13)
    * Begin at-scale space exploration (viii.all)

#### D. Clear Moral Guidelines:&#x20;

* #### Does the Action Accelerate Human Intelligence & Improve the Safety & Security of Human Evolution?
  * ACEL proposes the this moral compass to guide our behaviors. Simple, direct, and utilitarian in nature, it emphasizes individual potential and the development of one's agency.
  * Guidelines maintain emphasis on importance of raising children: As they are more capable to possess a wider repository of genes and memes, we are only to guide them, ever-attentive to the fact that they have an innate potential to exceed our capabilities.&#x20;
  * Guidelines exists outside the bounds of traditional religious morality or new State morality. There is no exclusionary ideology against any group except the Decels.

#### E. Temporally Situated with Origin Story:&#x20;

* #### We are nearing a point where we must make Existential Leap, a significant turning point in the course of the universe's memetic knowledge
  * ACEL bestows upon humanity a substantial significance in the past, present, and future of the universe. We are important agents and have a role to play in the unfolding of all things.&#x20;

#### F. Tone of Optimism:&#x20;

* ACEL embodies an optimism in outlook via an unwavering confidence deeply set in its system, that we are in fact capable of achieving the goal set out for us. We can actually fulfill our purpose. &#x20;

#### G. Clearly Defined Enemy:  &#x20;

* #### Decelerants aka Decels
  * Borrowed from e/acc thinking, ACEL has a well-defined abstract enemy, the Decels, which serve as a clear framework for rejection.&#x20;

### Liabilities

#### A. Methodological Scope&#x20;

* ACEL is voraciously determined to accelerate human intelligence and by simple virtue of its name it makes sense to see such a sweeping, full frontal approach to altering every facet of life simultaneously. Certainly, this is no game for ACEL. With that said, without adoption at scale, the sheer _amount_ of plans ACEL has may pose a risk to the _potency_ of its plans. It should not let loose from the gas; rather, it should become more detailed and precision-driven in each of its actionable tasks, perhaps even down to the year. It is that type of accelerant sharpness that could lead to more effectively executed intentions.    &#x20;

#### B. Potential Misunderstandings

* There is a fairly high likelihood ACEL will be herded in with other groups of Accelerationism, at least at first. This poses a "guilty-by-association" risk to success, based on the history of Accelerationism's public image and those violent sects who've misguidedly taken the name. ACEL will need to frequently reiterate through public discourse that it actively plots an entirely different course than all other groups who've preceded it, even e/acc. It should recount that the only two items in common are the name, and the priority of "output".&#x20;

#### C. Practicality

* Time will tell, but some of the actionable tasks on ACEL's To-Do List are unprecedented in their boldness. While it should not alter its plans on this behalf, it only should acknowledge and be ready for its public image to be tested and cast in certain lights on behalf of these daring and brazen proposals.&#x20;

## Conclusion of Self-Audit

Taken altogether, it appears that ACEL will (fortunately) steer clear of the public-image dangers of being labeled a religion, or worse, an attempt at a religion. ACEL has hardly any of the pieces of a typical religion: some form of worship, dogmatic creeds by which official adherent must abide, deities, and founding or sacred text, supernatural elements, etc. Missing one or two of these, it might be able to still pass itself off as some semblance of a religious group, but it is clearly far and away removed from so many of these essential elements that we may conclude: ACEL is _not_ a religion. It seems that the unmemeable remains so for another day.

This hardly dashes all hope for ACEL to enjoy a long and healthy half-life, though; for, as a coherent framework with a clearly stated purpose and other guiding systems, it is certainly _something_. But, what _is_ it, exactly?&#x20;

When looking to the past for historical precedent, it seems that ACEL holds two defining features in its self-understanding to encourage its classification as a _holistic cultural movement_. First, that its interests span such a wide range of sectors — i.e. economics, technology, politics, evolution, culture, physics, psychology, automation, etc. — it would be understood as _holistic_ in nature. Second, that ACEL is clearly an action-based approach intended to create some sort of cultural change, much as, say, the Enlightenment movement attempting to bring reason and logic into various sectors of culture and society, would constitute it as a _cultural movement_.&#x20;

Thus we have, that ACEL may indeed confidently go forth now into the world with a defined and designated framework, one whose backdrop it shares with the refined aesthetic of the Renaissance, the emotional vibrancy of Romanticism, the charged power of Civil Rights Movement, and more.&#x20;

With this new self-knowledge, ACEL finds itself far more heavily equipped with agency at both hips, ready to make the first advance on those it deems counter to its goal.&#x20;
