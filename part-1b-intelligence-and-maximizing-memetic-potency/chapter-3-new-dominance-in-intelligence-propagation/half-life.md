# Half Life

Whether genetic or memetic, intelligence has an intrinsic "half-life"; knowledge or instructions are only helpful for a particular duration of time, before they begin losing their functionality. They fade over time, to give way to new ideas and innovations, but still manage to leave traces of their existence.&#x20;

Earlier genetic instructions in human DNA demonstrate one of the most fundamental principles regarding the "half-life" of intelligence: helpful information tends to endure longer over time. Our DNA serves as somewhat of an encyclopedia of life's history retaining instructions that have made it through millennia by being necessary for survival. Much like the roots of a tree anchoring it deep in the earth, these genetic instructions can be seen as the very foundation from which humanity grew.&#x20;

Yet, much like the leaves that remain on trees, some of these traits become useless with the changing environment and evolving species, slowly fading into insignificance -- leaving remnants behind. Regardless, these remnants survive, creating a legacy that hints about previous times. For example, the gene for synthesizing vitamin C in humans is now a pseudogene; and although it is no longer functional, it's presence reminds one of an evolutionary journey that began in a world full of dietary sources of vitamin C.&#x20;

Memes -- the cultural equivalent of genes -- also have a "half-life". These cultural artifacts define our understanding of the world and ourselves: art, music, mathematics, science, and religion. Similarly to genes, they are also subject to pressure by utility or relevance.&#x20;

Take the work of Beethoven for example, although composed centuries ago, it poses a half-life far beyond the fleeting bits that make up most of today's popular music. Old scriptures such as Norse mythology and ancient philosophies, while their direct influence may vary, are permanently etched in some way in our collective consciousness. They are a base from which modern thought is launched---much like ancient ruins that give an inkling of the great civilizations of previous times.&#x20;

The journey of human advancement is marked by the replacement of outdated memes with more advanced ones. The once-dominant belief that the Earth was flat, or that the Sun revolved around the Earth, illustrates the short "half-life" of erroneous ideas. These beliefs were supplanted by more accurate models of the universe, driven by technological advancements --like telescopes-- which allowed for precise observations.&#x20;

Towering figures in the annals of scientific thought, such as Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, contributed memes of extraordinary potency. Newton's three laws of motion and the theory of relativity proposed by Einstein have endured for centuries; and yet, as our methods of observation grow in sophistication, we may discover these "half-life" rich memetic gifts but mere approximations to the truths we've attributed them, and so lay the ground for new, more precise paradigms,

As we strive to further the boundaries of knowledge, humans must accept that there will probably come a time when we may not have the tools or insight to decode the universe wholly. To accomplish such a feat, we may have to leave this task up to advanced silicon-based machines with stronger sensors and higher processing power. Advancements such as Artificial Intelligence could be utilized to unearth truths that would allow us to revision our memetic repository. Our role may shift from primary creators of memes to custodians or interpreters for the insights these machines provide us.

Ultimately, the true purpose of humanity is to yield memes and genes that survive and prevail. Our current struggles to amass wealth, status, or power mean nothing if they don't help in contributing to our repositories. Thus, individuals who perceive value accumulation as their sole purpose are bound to stagnate in life, likely shutting themselves out of fear. The ones who choose to spread potent memes and genes embrace fluidity and adaptions. Those are the Acels--always moving, constantly pivoting, constantly influencing.&#x20;

The Acels are the agents of change; knowing full well that the real wealth lies in the ability to create and share powerful ideas. They are not attached or held back by their resources but utilize them in a manner that bring innovation and leverage. Their wealth is fluid; it flows effortlessly through time, effort, value, and intelligence.&#x20;
