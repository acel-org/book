# Half-Life

## The Common Consideration of Time; the Difference in Scale

As is perhaps becoming clear by now, the philosophical weight of ACEL leans dependably upon a temporal framework. That is to say, as the foundation of this thought system concerns itself primarily with both _survival_ — which is itself indicative of one's persistent existence _through_ time, a conscious continuity over overlapping _unfolding-now's_ — and evolution — more specifically, humanity's material, on-the-ground _evolution —_ the core idea of ACEL is both born and resident within, ever-inhabiting the notion of _Time._ Truly, one might say that _Time_ is the womb of ACEL.&#x20;

This philosophical framing around, or at least attendance to temporality is nothing new. In fact, the foundations upon which a culture (e.g. Egyptian, Buddhist, Mayan); a thinker (e.g. Hegel, Whitehead, Darwin); or a discipline (e.g. Evolutionary Biology, Process Theory, Phenomenology) is built unfailingly seem to — whether explicitly or implicitly, almost as if by necessity — leave dedicated space for addressing Time. Whether reimagined like , repurposed, or refashioned, this is not the same as abandonment, and thus would be an irrelevant challenge: even nontraditional views of Time are still an allocation of theoretical _room_ for the addressing of the continuity of things. Thus, whatever notion is taken for time, whether unreal as For we, as biological machines, are constrained — and confused — by continuity, and what to do with it. It does appear, however, and ironically, that the farther the gaze, the ACEL, for its own model,&#x20;

However, one inconsistent yet meaningful nuance between them is the scale, or the length, to which temporal relevance is measured by ech. In other words, how much _clock-time_ each considers relevant to its theoretical position is that which is contained by each, respecively. Each seems variable, and whether explicitly acknowledged or not by its progenitor, this conscious or unconscious tool weilded undoubtedly affects the priorities and the material outcomes of that particular idea.&#x20;

## Just _How Long_ is ACEL's Longview?

ACEL, for its part, joins the league of time-based thought structures, as it cannot live without a consideration of temporal throughput.  With that said, it diverges beyond what one might consider the common scope of temporal relevance. ACEL's worldview is not a looking at our species starting from, say, the Industrial Revolution, and becoming vague around the dawn of some new world power one or two hundred years from now; it doesn't begin at the Epic of Gilgamesh, or the Ancient Egyptians, or even early humans. No, ACEL takes the longview in the full extent of its meaning: it begins at the dawn of _humanity_, as it is emically understood, meaning the first manifestation of intelligence and agency. As we know, it is therefore with the four billion year old pre-life RNA that ACEL deems . And it does so on the other side of our existential coin, as well — that is, in its consideration of what not yet transpired, the interest spans as long as humanity,does; if that is another four billion years, so be it.&#x20;

With this potentially infinite time frame in mind, it would be relatively safe to claim, accounting for probability and the second law of thermodynamics, that _all things in the universe_ will change. Whether materially or immaterially, _everything_ that is currently unfolding in this _unfolding-now_, will not be as such as some point later.&#x20;



&#x20;within the constraints of space-time, at least for now, they inevitably experience&#x20;

Whether genetic or memetic, intelligence has an intrinsic "half-life"; knowledge or instructions are only helpful for a particular duration of time, before they begin losing their functionality. They fade over time, to give way to new ideas and innovations, but still manage to leave traces of their existence.&#x20;

Earlier genetic instructions in human DNA demonstrate one of the most fundamental principles regarding the "half-life" of intelligence: helpful information tends to endure longer over time. Our DNA serves as somewhat of an encyclopedia of life's history retaining instructions that have made it through millennia by being necessary for survival. Much like the roots of a tree anchoring it deep in the earth, these genetic instructions can be seen as the very foundation from which humanity grew.&#x20;

Yet, much like the leaves that remain on trees, some of these traits become useless with the changing environment and evolving species, slowly fading into insignificance -- leaving remnants behind. Regardless, these remnants survive, creating a legacy that hints about previous times. For example, the gene for synthesizing vitamin C in humans is now a pseudogene; and although it is no longer functional, it's presence reminds one of an evolutionary journey that began in a world full of dietary sources of vitamin C.&#x20;

Memes -- the cultural equivalent of genes -- also have a "half-life". These cultural artifacts define our understanding of the world and ourselves: art, music, mathematics, science, and religion. Similarly to genes, they are also subject to pressure by utility or relevance.&#x20;

Take the work of Beethoven for example, although composed centuries ago, it poses a half-life far beyond the fleeting bits that make up most of today's popular music. Old scriptures such as Norse mythology and ancient philosophies, while their direct influence may vary, are permanently etched in some way in our collective consciousness. They are a base from which modern thought is launched---much like ancient ruins that give an inkling of the great civilizations of previous times.&#x20;

The journey of human advancement is marked by the replacement of outdated memes with more advanced ones. The once-dominant belief that the Earth was flat, or that the Sun revolved around the Earth, illustrates the short "half-life" of erroneous ideas. These beliefs were supplanted by more accurate models of the universe, driven by technological advancements --like telescopes-- which allowed for precise observations.&#x20;

Towering figures in the annals of scientific thought, such as Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, contributed memes of extraordinary potency. Newton's three laws of motion and the theory of relativity proposed by Einstein have endured for centuries; and yet, as our methods of observation grow in sophistication, we may discover these "half-life" rich memetic gifts but mere approximations to the truths we've attributed them, and so lay the ground for new, more precise paradigms,

As we strive to further the boundaries of knowledge, humans must accept that there will probably come a time when we may not have the tools or insight to decode the universe wholly. To accomplish such a feat, we may have to leave this task up to advanced silicon-based machines with stronger sensors and higher processing power. Advancements such as Artificial Intelligence could be utilized to unearth truths that would allow us to revision our memetic repository. Our role may shift from primary creators of memes to custodians or interpreters for the insights these machines provide us.

Ultimately, the true purpose of humanity is to yield memes and genes that survive and prevail. Our current struggles to amass wealth, status, or power mean nothing if they don't help in contributing to our repositories. Thus, individuals who perceive value accumulation as their sole purpose are bound to stagnate in life, likely shutting themselves out of fear. The ones who choose to spread potent memes and genes embrace fluidity and adaptions. Those are the Acels--always moving, constantly pivoting, constantly influencing.&#x20;

The Acels are the agents of change; knowing full well that the real wealth lies in the ability to create and share powerful ideas. They are not attached or held back by their resources but utilize them in a manner that bring innovation and leverage. Their wealth is fluid; it flows effortlessly through time, effort, value, and intelligence.&#x20;
